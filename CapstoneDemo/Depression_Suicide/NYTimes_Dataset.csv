He was the final tin can in the wobbly stack of tin cans that was my life as the working mother of two young children, and his furry Wheaten face brought everything tumbling down.   Working Mother magazine has a cover story in this month's issue about depression in working mothers — more specifically, what they call post-postpartum depression.   You are back at work. You've gotten past the months where hormones are automatically blamed. You're through the colic and the round-the-clock feedings and you even have something that resembles a schedule. You fit back into your clothes, or you've faced reality and bought new ones. And then you find yourself sobbing while walking the dog.   Or, in the case of the women profiled in Working Mother, sobbing in the bathroom at work. Or in the car driving the toddlers to day care.   As the story's author, Katherine Eban, writes:   These days, most women learn about the risks of postpartum depression, the haze of new motherhood that can threaten to plunge them into a crippling, if brief, depression. About 15 percent of new mothers succumb to it, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. What most women don't read about in brochures in their ob-gyn's waiting room is that some of the triggers for postpartum depression — feelings of isolation and overwhelming stress — can wallop you years later. It's often their can-do qualities — juggling deadlines and diapers, deal-making and day care — that enable many working women to sail through the challenging early years of their baby's life, only to tip them into serious depression once the hardest part has passed.  The article includes a checklist from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). If you have more than five of the symptoms, it might be wise to seek help:    A lack of interest or enjoyment in usually pleasurable activities and hobbies Feelings of hopelessness and/or pessimism  Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and/or helplessness Irritability, restlessness, anxiety Fatigue and decreased energy Decreased interest in sex Difficulty concentrating and making decisions Sleep problems, such as insomnia, wakefulness at night or excessive sleeping Overeating or appetite loss Thoughts of suicide Persistent aches or pains, or digestive problems that do not ease with treatment     One in five women will suffer depression in their lifetime, according to the NIMH, a rate that is twice that of men. And it is estimated that more than a third of women of child-bearing age suffer symptoms at any given moment.   But is that rate higher among mothers who work outside the home? The editors of Working Mother think that it is. They did an online poll of 500 working mothers last month, and 91.4 percent had felt depressed at some point since having children. (And more than half of those said it was after their baby was 3 months old or more — in other words, after the traditional postpartum period.)  Ninety-one percent. Nearly every working mother out there. Obviously an online poll of this type isn't scientific, but even so, I was surprised.   I figured the number would be higher.   p.s. I am not serious about that last sentence, of course. I would guess that 91 percent number is too high, and that women who would respond to an online survey like this are a self-selecting group. But I am also certain that there are many women who are suffering this way, most of them silently...   p.p.s.: I did get help all those years ago, in the form of medication and recommitment to getting exercise and sleep. Riley, who sits at my feet as I type this, hasn't made me cry for a very long time.   ",https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/08/blogs/08parenting-post-pos155.html
92,Clues in the Cycle of Suicide,"On average, about 700 Americans kill themselves each week — but in the fine-weather weeks of May and June, the toll rises closer to 800, sometimes higher. Every year, suicide peaks with the tulips and lilacs — increasing roughly 15 percent over the annual average to create one of psychiatry’s most consistent epidemiological patterns. It may seem perverse that the period of spring and early summer, as the psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison puts it in her splendid book “Night Falls Fast,” should contain “a capacity for self-murder that winter less often has.” Yet it does.",https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/clues-in-the-cycle-of-suicide/

The subject is one she no doubt wants everyone to understand. The movie is “My Depression (The Up and Down and Up of It),” and it’s about her struggle with that condition. The film is adapted from her 2005 picture book — the screenplay is credited to Ms. Swados, David Wachtenheim and Robert Marianetti (the three also directed the film) — and it’s as charming and whimsical a discussion of depression as you’re likely to find. And as musical.

183,"Postpartum Depression, Take Two","Heather Armstrong is pregnant again; she is due to give birth to a daughter, her second, early this summer.   Her older girl, Leta, (which rhymes with pita) just turned five, and Armstrong's book (another baby) is out this week. ""It Sucked and then I Cried: How I Had a Baby, A Breakdown and a Much Needed Margarita"" is a funny, irreverent look at becoming a mother. The fact that it makes you laugh so often is quite a trick, since it is about, among other things, the postpartum breakdown that led to Armstrong's stay on a psychiatric ward a few months after Leta was born.  Armstrong, who writes the wildly popular blog Dooce (which became wildly popular, in part, when she began chronicling her depression in real time years ago and followers gathered to give advice) said she was more than a little wary of having a second child given what she went through the first time around.   ""There were many, many conversations and back and forth and arguments about whether we wanted to do this again,"" she said when we spoke by phone a few days ago. ""Many, many, many, many, conversations.""   She had been on anti-depression medication as a young adult, and stopped taking it in order to become pregnant with Leta. Looking back, she said, there were signs while she was pregnant of the trouble to come &#151; a memorable ""freak-out"" during the torturously timed renovation of the kitchen in her ninth month comes to mind &#151; but ""I figured it was hormones, renovations are stressful, right?"" she said.    After Leta was born, her despair deepened. ""I was surprised,"" she said. ""I thought it was supposed to get easier with time, but it got worse."" She blamed sleep deprivation, but even when Leta began sleeping for longer stretches over the months, her mother was wide awake and crying.   At her nadir, Armstrong writes in her book, she was hurling full gallon milk jugs at her husband Jon's head. She became ""so frustrated with the collapsible stroller"" that she threw ""it off the porch into the yard and then slammed the front door so hard that the doorknob had fallen off."" Many times over the first months of her daughter's life, she continues:     I stood in front of the medicine cabinet in the kitchen trying to figure out whether or not I had the nerve to take an entire bottle of Risperdal. I thought about suicide every day during those months. I thought about how I would do it; perhaps I would hang myself with the dog's leash, or maybe I'd grab every single pill we had in the medicine cabinet and drown them with a couple of shots of tequila. I wanted to do something, anything to stop the pain.      Finally she checked herself into the hospital, on a night when the only psychiatric bed available was in the lock-down ward. A doctor she describes as her savior put her on large doses of three different medications &#151; doses too large for a patient to take without round the clock monitoring. ""He gave me enough drugs to kill a large rhinoceros,"" she said, ""and it allowed me to sit still for the first time in seven months."" That night she slept all night, for the first time since Leta had been born.   Over the years she had decreased her doses of those medications, but was still taking all three until she decided to get pregnant a second time. Two were unsafe during pregnancy. So she weaned off of those, staying only on Prozac, and keeping a close watch on her emotions for signs of trouble.   ""So far so good,"" she says. ""Jon and I talk about it constantly, he and I check in with each other every day &#151; How am I feeling? Where is my head at?"" She had flown from her home in Salt Lake City to Manhattan for the first leg of her book tour when we spoke, and when she'd arrived here the day before she'd ""had a bit of a breakdown at JFK,"" she said. She couldn't get her suitcase off the luggage carousel and began to ""lose it"" when no one would offer a pregnant woman any help.   ""But who doesn't have a breakdown at JFK, right?"" she asked. ""I didn't end up in the corner rocking back and forth, so that's progress.""  After her first baby was born, Armstrong was alone all day, with no babysitter, no mommy network, and a husband who left every day for stressful work. This time around her husband is working from home and her mother is retired and ready to help. Now she has doctors to call and a therapist she sees regularly, and thousands of blog readers she can talk to every day.   ""If all that doesn't work, I will go back to the hospital for help,"" she says. ""That's the message. You can get help.""    This is the time of year &#151; as Mother's Day approaches and Father's Day follows &#151; when there is a surge of new books about parenting. Every Friday for the next few months, at least, I will explore some of those new titles &#151; not just the ""how-tos"", but also novels and memoirs and histories that touch on what it means to be a parent. I'll keep a list of what I am reading over on the right-hand column of Motherlode for anyone who wants to read along.

Taking the new antidepressants, some of my patients said they found themselves more confident and decisive. I used these claims as a jumping-off point for speculation: what if future medications had the potential to modify personality traits in people who had never experienced mood disorder?

230,Will the Pandemic Result in More Suicides?,"Even before we entered this darkest of winters, when Covid-19 is relentlessly causing more and more sickness and death — not to mention additional stress, isolation and economic pain — there was evidence suggesting that significantly more people have thought about ending their lives during the pandemic than in recent years. In August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the results of a nationwide survey conducted during the last week in June: More than 40 percent of those who responded reported symptoms of anxiety or depression or increased substance use, in addition to other struggles. And more than 10 percent said that they had seriously considered suicide in the past 30 days, compared with just over 4 percent who said the same thing in 2018 — and who were referring to suicidal ideation over the previous 12 months. “We want to know, who is most at risk from suicide in the pandemic,” says Paul Nestadt, a psychiatrist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who was not involved in the survey. And yet, he adds, “we won’t know until it’s mostly over.” That’s because it can take a year or two for the C.D.C. to collect and analyze national mortality data.",https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/magazine/will-the-pandemic-result-in-more-suicides.html

They had become collaborators on a screenplay, to be completed the following summer. There never had been, as Judith recounted, anything remotely “romantic” about their relationship: “I'd never even found him particularly attractive,” she shrugged. But now Frank's letter seemed to be invested with erotic double meanings, with intensely sentimental innuendoes. She found herself fantasizing about him. She became, at the same time, increasingly preoccupied by the importance of the screen drama they were writing together. Still, Judith has never believed that it was his letter alone that “caused” her manic attack: “I don't think I'd ever have fastened on him or on the screenplay,” she told me, “if I hadn't already been getting crazy at the time Frank's letter arrived.”",https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/24/archives/from-joy-to-depression-new-insights-into-the-chemistry-of-moods.html

545,The Suicide Detective,"For reasons that have eluded people forever, many of us seem bent on our own destruction. Recently more human beings have been dying by suicide annually than by murder and warfare combined. Despite the progress made by science, medicine and mental-health care in the 20th century — the sequencing of our genome, the advent of antidepressants, the reconsidering of asylums and lobotomies — nothing has been able to drive down the suicide rate in the general population. In the United States, it has held relatively steady since 1942. Worldwide, roughly one million people kill themselves every year. Last year, more active-duty U.S. soldiers killed themselves than died in combat; their suicide rate has been rising since 2004. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the suicide rate among middle-aged Americans has climbed nearly 30 percent since 1999. In response to that widely reported increase, Thomas Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., appeared on PBS NewsHour and advised viewers to cultivate a social life, get treatment for mental-health problems, exercise and consume alcohol in moderation. In essence, he was saying, keep out of those demographic groups with high suicide rates, which include people with a mental illness like a mood disorder, social isolates and substance abusers, as well as elderly white males, young American Indians, residents of the Southwest, adults who suffered abuse as children and people who have guns handy.",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/magazine/the-suicide-detective.html

The fact that taking one’s own life can exist on a parallel track with our ordinary days, in which we go out to dinner or put our children to bed or worry about growing old, always puts me in mind of W. H. Auden’s poem “Musée des Beaux Arts.” Overtly about the poet’s gazing upon Bruegel’s painting “The Fall of Icarus,” the poem evokes the relativity of tragedy and the isolation of despair: “About suffering,” it begins, “they were never wrong,/ The old Masters: how well they understood/ Its human position: how it takes place/ While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/opinion/kate-spade-depression.html

The issue surfaced in the early 1990's, when the drugs -- Prozac and Zoloft the most common among them -- first hit the market, and was soon dismissed. But recent studies have reignited concern. The labeling change is intended to make doctors more cautious about prescribing the drugs and patients more cautious about taking them. Such vigilance is crucial.

Alexander Waugh wrote about his famous progenitors with a mixture of bemusement and sangfroid, regaling the reader with one outrageous anecdote after another, even as he showed how the bonds of affection and resentment bound one generation of fathers and sons to another, and how that theme of filial love and dread animated much of the Waugh family’s voluminous canon of novels, memoirs, diaries and letters.",https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/10/books/10book.html
