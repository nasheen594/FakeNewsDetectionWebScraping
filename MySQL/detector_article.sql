INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (1,'The surge of Covid-19 infections for unvaccinated people is only beginning, experts warn','With the recent increase of \"We will see this big, steep acceleration,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director for the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children\'s Hospital, told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper on Friday. \"As bad as things are right now in the South, they are about to get worse for lots of unvaccinated individuals.\" , Officials in Southern states, where vaccination rates have generally lagged other parts of the country, are working to get the message out. , In Georgia, the case rate has more than tripled over the last 14-day period, the state health department announced Friday as it urged residents to get vaccinated since the Delta variant is more transmissible than earlier Covid-19 strains., \"Unfortunately, we can expect Covid numbers to keep growing. People who are unvaccinated or skip their second dose of vaccine are targets for infection,\" said Georgia health commissioner Dr. Kathleen E. Toomey., More Americans may be responding to the crisis, as recent data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the pace of vaccinations is going up -- especially in states where vaccination rates were lowest., The US averaged 652,084 doses administered per day -- whether a first or a second shot -- over the past week as of Friday, according to the CDC. That\'s up almost 27% from the average seen about three weeks ago. , The increase has been sharper in some states with the lowest vaccine adoption rates., Alabama, which has the lowest percentage of its population fully vaccinated (34%), saw its seven-day average of daily doses more than double from where it was three weeks earlier: 13,131 a day vs. 6,138, according to the CDC., That average also more than doubled in three weeks in Arkansas (9,842 daily vs. 3,962 daily) and Louisiana (13,500 daily doses vs. 6,411 daily). Each of those two states have less than 38% of its populations fully vaccinated, according to CDC data., As of Friday morning, 49.5% of the US population was fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. The fully vaccinated figure was 57.9% for people eligible for inoculation -- those ages 12 and up. , Health leaders continue to highlight that Covid-19 vaccines are very effective at preventing serious illness and death. The latest data from the CDC shows less than 0.004% of people fully vaccinated against Covid-19 experienced a breakthrough case resulting in hospitalization and less than 0.001% died from the disease. , The agency reported a total of 6,587 breakthrough cases as of July 26, including 6,239 hospitalizations and 1,263 deaths. At that time, more than 163 million people in the US were fully vaccinated. , Most of the breakthrough cases  -- 74% -- occurred among adults who were 65 or older., Mask mandates return for vaccinated and unvaccinated, Due to the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant, officials are preaching for all Americans -- regardless of vaccination status -- to be mindful of their surroundings. , Aerosols containing Covid-19 can travel as easily as the smoke from a cigarette, Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said Friday., \"If you want to understand what an aerosol is, just think of somebody smoking,\" Osterholm told CNN. \"If you can smell a cigarette in the location you\'re at, then you\'re breathing someone else\'s air that may have the virus in it.\", Osterholm noted that while indoor transmission of the virus is the main challenge, there are examples of Covid-19 being transmitted outdoors, when people were close together for extended periods of time., Because of this, mask mandates are making a return in more cities. , On Friday, the cities of Birmingham, New Orleans, and Louisville each announced plans to reinstitute mask mandates to lower indoor transmission., \"If we take the steps that are necessary to squash the amount of disease that is there now, we can do so in a matter of weeks, if we all get vaccinated, if we wear masks,\" CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told Fox News on Friday., The CDC this week changed its guidance on mask usage and advises vaccinated people to resume mask wearing indoors in areas of \"high\" or \"substantial\" transmission of the virus. That currently covers more than 80% of the US population, according to a CNN analysis of data published Friday by the CDC., A recent study shows the Delta variant can produce similar amounts of virus in both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, yet real-world data is demonstrating that unvaccinated people are at much higher risk for severe illness. , Coronavirus case rates have jumped as the Delta variant has increased its grip in the United States., The US averaged more than 77,800 new daily cases over the last week -- an average that\'s generally risen since the country hit a 2021 low of 11,299 daily cases on June 22, according to Johns Hopkins University data., Hospitalizations also have risen. More than 43,700 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals on Wednesday -- a number that\'s generally risen since a 2021 low of 15,906 on June 27, according to Department of Health and Human Services data., At Los Angeles\' Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center, the vast majority of hospitalized Covid-19 patients were not vaccinated., \"(Most) say, \'If I knew that I was going to feel this bad, I would have gotten the vaccine,\'\" the center\'s director, Dr. Thomas Yadegar, told CNN on Saturday., , ICUs are filling up again, As the Delta variant spreads, hospitalizations are accumulating to levels of concern. , Mississippi, which has one of the lowest rates of vaccination among US states, is dealing with a skyrocketing level of Covid-19 patients needing hospitalization. , Data from the Mississippi Department of Health on Friday showed that out of 827 ICU beds statewide, only 107, or approximately 13%, are currently available. All 88 beds in the University of Mississippi Medical Center\'s intensive care unit, the state\'s largest, are full. , Hospitalizations are beginning to be seen in younger age groups, state health officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said Thursday. He pointed to data that shows 88% of hospitalizations are among unvaccinated people, and it is having a \"significant spillover effect to older, vaccinated Mississippians.\", In Texas, Austin Public Health says the region is facing the lowest-staffed ICU bed capacity since the beginning of the pandemic, with only 16 staffed beds available., \"Our ICU capacity is reaching a critical point where the level of risk to the entire community has significantly increased, and not just to those who are needing treatment for Covid,\" Austin-Travis County Health Authority Dr. Desmar Walkes said on Friday. \"If we fail to come together as a community now, we jeopardize the lives of loved ones who might need critical care.\", Throughout the state, several trauma service areas each had less than 10 ICU beds available on Friday, according to Texas health data. Some of the areas affected include Amarillo, Wichita Falls, Abilene, Killeen, Waco, Beaumont, and Victoria. , Florida health care facilities continue to prepare for the surge, as the AdventHealth Hospital System stopped all non-emergency surgeries and procedures due to high Covid-19 hospitalization., AdventHealth Central Florida Chief Clinical Officer Dr. Neil Finkler said on Friday that more than 90% of the Covid-19 patients currently hospitalized are unvaccinated. , \"None of these patients thought they would get the virus, but the Delta variant has proven to be so highly contagious that even the young and the healthy, including pregnant patients, are now starting to fill up our hospitals,\" Finkler said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/31/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html',1,1),(2,'Five takeaways on the science behind CDC\'s latest mask guidance','With surges in Covid-19 cases driven by the Delta variant, most Americans are now being advised to wear masks indoors -- regardless of vaccination status -- by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Since CDC guidelines updated Tuesday, we have learned more about the science that motivated these changes, both from a leaked agency document and a study published Friday by the agency. The new research reinforces the ongoing need for everyone who can get vaccinated to get vaccinated. , Here are five key takeaways:, Delta is super transmissible, We knew Delta was spreading fast. In the United States and around the world, it swiftly overtook another variant, Alpha, that was already more transmissible than earlier strains., New research from Helix, a company whose Covid-19 tests have helped track a number of variants, shows how quickly that happened: Alpha made up 67% of cases in mid-May. Ten weeks later, it was down to just 2.3% -- replaced by Delta, estimated around 90% of cases., \"It\'s one of the most transmissible viruses we know about. Measles, chickenpox, this -- they\'re all up there,\" Walensky told CNN Thursday., In terms of how quickly they spread, early strains of the coronavirus were similar to the common cold, according to an internal CDC document. Left unchecked, an infected person may have transmitted the virus to two or three people, on average, early in the outbreak. But now, with Delta, that number could be five to nine., This may be partly explained by Delta\'s ability to \"replicate faster and lead to higher viral loads earlier in infection compared to other variants,\" according to the preprint study from Helix., The CDC document also notes that Delta is \"likely more severe\" than what came before it., Breakthrough infections may be contagious, but spread is driven by the unvaccinated, Prior to Delta, even if you developed a breakthrough infection, you\'d likely have less virus in your airways. Thus, you might be less likely to infect someone else if you were vaccinated., Experts say that vaccination still makes it less likely that you\'ll catch Covid-19 in the first place -- but for those who do, new data suggests that Delta causes similar viral loads in both vaccinated and unvaccinated people., The data is based on an outbreak investigation in Massachusetts in which nearly three-quarters of infected people had been fully vaccinated. Of them, 8 in 10 developed symptoms, but only a few were hospitalized and none died., \"The idea that someone could still test positive and still develop enough virus in their nose and mouth to transmit is really what this data is showing,\" explains CNN\'s Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta., The finding that the Delta variant resulted in similar viral loads \"was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC\'s updated mask recommendation,\" Walensky said Friday. , But viral load by itself may not be a definitive measure of contagiousness. For example, the immune systems of vaccinated people includes a number of moving parts that might impact how much they are able to spread it., Walensky said that ongoing outbreak investigations will help uncover more about what happens when these breakthrough infections do occur., \"We are now continuing to follow those clusters to understand the impact of forward transmission of those vaccinated people,\" she said earlier this week. \"But again, I want to reiterate, we believe the vast majority of transmission is occurring in unvaccinated people and through unvaccinated people.\", Vaccination is the best tool against Delta , The effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines is a spectrum: As you move from asymptomatic infection to hospitalization and death, effectiveness eventually reaches over 90%. , CDC documents estimate that vaccines reduce the risk of infection three-fold, and the risk of severe disease or death 10-fold or greater., \"Getting vaccinated continues to prevent severe illness, hospitalization and death -- even with Delta,\" Walensky said this week. , CNN\'s Gupta pointed out we\'ve seen this trend reflected in the Covid-19 numbers on a national level., \"Last year when we would talk about a rise or surge in cases, almost predictably, you would see a certain percentage of hospitalizations that would follow thereafter, and a certain percentage of people who would die a few weeks after that,\" he said., But the country has not yet seen the same magnitude of tandem hospitalizations and deaths. Experts say this metric is key when discussing if and when people might be advised to get a booster shot -- but as for now, the vaccines continue to hold up in this regard., Masks are another necessary tool, More than 8 in 10 Americans live in a county with enough Covid-19 transmission for CDC to recommend people mask up indoors, even if they\'re vaccinated., The move has already prompted a number of places, like businesses and school districts, to update their mask policies., It\'s not just Delta\'s prevalence and contagiousness that motivated the CDC to update its guidance, but also lower uptake of Covid-19 vaccine than hoped., \"Given higher transmissibility and current vaccine coverage, universal masking is essential to reduce transmission of the Delta variant,\" internal CDC documents say., Similarly, research published Friday in Nature Scientific Reports maintains that vaccination alone won\'t stop the rise of new variants. The authors also warn of an \"evolutionary arms race\" where the virus may be allowed to spread and evolve among vaccinated people, potentially outsmarting our immunity in the future., However, experts say we can bring the virus under control by layering strategies on top of vaccination -- masks especially, but also measures like distancing and testing., \"The measures we need to get this under control -- they\'re extreme. The measures you need are extreme,\" Walensky told CNN., As more people get vaccinated, we\'ll see more breakthrough infections, Breakthrough infections were always expected. Simply put, no vaccine is 100% effective., It also makes sense that, as more and more people get vaccinated, you\'ll see more breakthrough infections., In April, mathematician and epidemiologist Adam Kucharski wrote on Twitter that these \"patterns in highly vaccinated populations don\'t always do what you may assume.\", As illustrated in CDC documents, a mathematical formula known as Bayes\' theorem can give us some rough estimates: , In a population that\'s 60% fully vaccinated with an 80%-effective vaccine, you\'d expect nearly a quarter of infections to be breakthroughs. , If you change either number to 70%, breakthroughs might approach nearly a third of  infections., This, of course, assumes everyone in a population is the same. You might see a disproportionate number of breakthrough infections, for example, in populations where vaccine effectiveness could be on the lower end -- like people who are immunocompromised or live in nursing homes. , But when we see percentages of vaccine effectiveness, that\'s talking about the population as a whole. It\'s not to say that any individual person is 70% or 80% or 90% protected. , For now, there\'s no surefire way to measure one\'s own immunity to the virus, despite a focus on antibodies. In fact, the country\'s leading health authorities advise against antibody testing in order to determine whether you\'re protected., \"The immune system is really complex and involves T cells as well as B cells,\" Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist at University of California, San Francisco, told CNN in an email. , \"Antibodies do not tell the whole story of immunity.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/31/health/covid-breakthrough-cdc-masks-five-takeaways/index.html',1,2),(3,'What you need to know about the Delta variant if you\'re pregnant','The Delta variant of Covid-19 is dominating cases worldwide, and health officials in some countries are sounding alarm over its impact on pregnant women. Several of England\'s top health officials issued a joint statement on Friday urging pregnant women to get vaccinated against the coronavirus. They pointed to new data showing that 98% of expectant mothers admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 in the country since May were unvaccinated. , The World Health Organization (WHO) has also previously said that infected, pregnant women face an increased risk of developing severe Covid-19 compared with non-pregnant women of a similar age. , One concern is that risk might be even higher with the Delta strain, which has been shown to be more contagious and can cause more severe disease compared to the earlier variants of the virus. , Here\'s what you need to know., Is Delta more dangerous if you\'re pregnant?, The Delta variant is more contagious and can cause more severe disease for everyone, including pregnant women., The latest data gathered by the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) showed the number of pregnant women that are being admitted to hospital with Covid-19 is increasing in the UK due to the Delta strain. , \"Compared to the original Covid virus the new variants (alpha and then delta) caused progressively more severe disease in pregnant women,\" Andrew Shennan, professor of obstetrics at King\'s College London, said in a statement to the UK\'s Science Media Centre. \"This included need for ventilation, intensive care admission and pneumonia, more than 50% more likely to occur,\" he added., The data collected by UKOSS show that around 33% of women in hospital with Covid-19 needed respiratory support and that 15% needed intensive care., The UKOSS data only includes pregnant women. However, the group said that while the increase in hospitalizations was broadly in line with the current rise in Covid-19 hospital admissions in the UK\'s general population, the data highlights an increase among pregnant women needing care for acute symptoms. , What about risks to the baby?, Previous studies have shown that Covid-19 infection raises the risk of negative outcomes for both the mother and the baby. These risks include preeclampsia, infections, admission to hospital intensive care units and even death., According to an April study published in JAMA Pediatrics that looked at over 2,000 pregnant women in 43 medical institutions across 18 countries, babies born to mothers infected with the coronavirus were also at a somewhat higher risk of preterm birth and low birth weight., The new data collected by UKOSS showed that one in five women admitted to hospital with serious Covid-19 symptoms went on to give birth prematurely, and the likelihood of delivery by C-section doubled. One in five babies born to mothers with coronavirus symptoms were also admitted to neonatal units., Is the vaccine safe for pregnant people?, Yes. Studies and real-world data have shown there are no specific safety concerns for pregnant people or their babies on taking a Covid-19 vaccine. , \"Hundreds of thousands of pregnant women worldwide have been vaccinated, safely and effectively protecting themselves against Covid and dramatically reducing their risk of serious illness or harm to their baby,\" Gill Walton, the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives in the UK, said in a statement on Friday. , The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization in the UK and Australia\'s Technical Advisory Group on Immunization all advise pregnant women to get a Covid-19 shot. The WHO says that pregnant women should get the vaccine in situations where the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks -- such as if they are living in areas with high number of cases., Some countries have even prioritized immunization for pregnant people. The Australian government said anyone who is pregnant and over the age of 16 can get the vaccine now, even though the slow vaccine rollout there means that only those above the age of 40 are currently eligible for the shot among the general population., The Canadian provinces of Ontario and British Columbia have also prioritized vaccination for those who are pregnant. , But the picture is mixed across the globe. According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University (JHU), 20 countries currently recommend the use of the Covid-19 shot in pregnancy, while 39 permit it. , A further 33 countries permit the vaccines in some situations -- for example if expectant mothers face increased risk of catching Covid-19 because of her job or has underlying health condition that put them at risk of developing severe disease. , According to the JHU data, 51 countries either don\'t recommend the vaccine in pregnancy at all, or only under certain conditions. The countries include Germany, which has cited a lack of safety data as the reason for its position, because pregnant people were not part of the safety trials. , What about those who are breastfeeding?, The WHO has recommended breastfeeding women should be vaccinated and said women should not stop breastfeeding due to vaccination, because the shots are unlikely to pose any risk for the baby., Covid vaccines do not harm the placenta or cause infertility, Myths about the Covid-19 vaccines impacting infertility or hurting the placenta have been swirling on social media, but scientists have been clear: these have no scientific basis., There\'s no biological basis behind the claims that Covid-19 vaccines can harm the placenta, the organ that provides a growing baby oxygen and nutrients during pregnancy., Dr. Richard Beigi, who sits on the Immunization, Infectious Disease, and Public Health Preparedness Expert Work Group of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said there was \"no clear scientific reason to think the new vaccine would cause fertility problems.\", Similarly, it is impossible to catch coronavirus from the vaccine, as the shots do not contain live Covid-19 virus., \"You cannot catch Covid-19 from the vaccines and cannot pass it to your baby through your breast milk,\" according to the official advice from the UK\'s National Health Service., In fact, research has shown that most pregnant women who got the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines passed protective antibodies to their newborns, measured in breast milk and the placenta.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/31/health/delta-variant-pregnancy-vaccination-cmd-intl/index.html',1,3),(4,'If we want kids back in school and the economy to prosper, more of the US needs to get vaccinated, expert says ','The United States is facing a pivotal moment in the coronavirus pandemic, given that the \"If we want to keep our kids in school, if we want to protect the economy, if we want our country to get through this pandemic, we have to leave no stone unturned in making sure people get vaccinated,\" US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper on Thursday., Murthy\'s comment came after President Joe Biden announced that federal employees must attest to being vaccinated against Covid-19 or face strict protocols, including testing once or twice a week, wearing a mask and other heath mitigation measures. , On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shared a new study that led to its new indoor mask guidance, showing the Delta variant produced similar amounts of virus in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals if they get infected. , \"High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus,\" said CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement Friday., The finding \"was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC\'s updated mask recommendation,\" Walensky said., Walensky defended the agency\'s guidance on wearing masks in schools Friday evening, telling Fox News it was necessary to protect kids, their families and communities., \"Right now the best way to (prevent outbreaks in schools) is to have everybody masked because we do have disease in the community,\" she said. \"And hopefully as we have vaccinations for kids, and less disease in the community, we\'ll be able to scale back on the mask wearing.\", Also emerging late this week: The Delta variant appears to cause more severe illness and spread as easily as chickenpox, according to an internal document from the CDC., The document -- a slide presentation first reported by The Washington Post -- outlines unpublished data that shows fully vaccinated people, even if they don\'t get sick, might spread the Delta variant at the same rate as unvaccinated people., Meanwhile, coronavirus case rates have jumped as the Delta variant has increased its grip in the United States., The US averaged more than 66,900 new daily cases over the last week -- an average that\'s generally risen since the country hit a 2021 low of 11,299 daily cases on June 22, according to Johns Hopkins University data., Hospitalizations have also risen. More than 39,000 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals on Monday -- a number that\'s generally risen since a 2021 low of nearly 15,988 on June 27, according to Department of Health and Human Services data., Data shows a difference between areas with high and low vaccination rates. , Average hospitalization rates are nearly three times higher in states that have fully vaccinated less than half of their residents compared with those that have vaccinated more than half of their residents, according to a CNN analysis of federal data. , And Covid-19 case and death rates over the past week are more than twice as high among states that have vaccinated less than half of their residents, on average. , With only 49.5% of Americans fully vaccinated, former US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said Thursday that he anticipates more closures as the Delta variant keeps spreading. And with some mask and vaccine mandates already implemented, Murthy anticipates more will be added., \"The private sector is already stepping up to create verification systems,\" Murthy said. \"What we are going to see more and more, Anderson, in the weeks and months ahead is, I believe, we\'re going to see more universities, more hospitals, more businesses, more retail establishments looking to put rules in place to require people to get vaccinated.\", , CDC document on Delta variant: \'The war has changed\', The study released by the CDC on Friday described 469 Massachusetts residents infected in a July outbreak in Barnstable County, which includes Provincetown. No deaths were reported among the residents. , About 74% -- or 346 cases -- had been fully vaccinated. Of those, 79% reported symptoms. Genetically sequenced cases revealed the Delta variant as the main culprit., Meanwhile, the internal CDC document that said the variant appears to cause more severe infection advises that the agency should \"acknowledge the war has changed.\", It recommends vaccine mandates and universal mask requirements., The CDC director confirmed the authenticity of the document., \"I think people need to understand that we\'re not crying wolf here. This is serious,\" Walensky told CNN., The document says the Delta variant is about as transmissible as chickenpox, with each infected person, on average, infecting eight or nine others. The original lineage was about as transmissible as the common cold, with each infected person passing the virus to about two other people on average., , NC school system to require masks indoors, One of the most contentious issues across the country surrounds wearing face coverings in schools. Several areas announced Friday they would require or recommend masks, while Florida\'s governor, while signing an executive order, again said parents should make the decisions., In North Carolina\'s most populous area, Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, the school board voted for masks to be worn indoors. , \"This decision aligns with local and state guidance, as well as national guidelines, which address the Delta variants of (coronavirus),\" said Elyse Dashew, chairperson of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools Board of Education, according to CNN affiliate WSOC. \"The infection numbers in our county are cause for serious concern -- and significant precautions to protect our students and staff.\", Only one of the board\'s nine members voted against the measure., In Massachusetts, schools will meet five days a week for in-person learning and masks are recommended for some people., The state\'s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education said all students on buses should wear a face covering. It also recommended students in kindergarten through sixth grade should wear masks as should unvaccinated students in higher grades and all unvaccinated staff members., In Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear urged schools to implement mask mandates for the upcoming academic year., Beshear said that schools who do not mandate masks \"will fail, and it will be the students who lose out on in-person learning that they would otherwise be in, and it\'s unprotected parents and grandparents that may pay a bigger price.\", Kentucky\'s Department of Health, in light of the CDC\'s new guidance, recommends all people inside schools wear masks., Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has issued an executive order with emergency rules that prevent the implementation of mask mandates in schools., DeSantis, who has been a vocal critic against the CDC\'s recommendations for masking in schools, doubled down on his position, stating there will be no lockdowns, school closures, restrictions, or mandates in his state. , The order was issued \"to protect parents\' freedom to choose whether their children wear masks,\" the governor said in a news release., The executive order says the CDC\'s guidance \"lacks a well-grounded scientific justification\" while referring to a Brown University study the governor says found no correlation with Covid-19 data from schools and mask mandates., After Miami-Dade County Public Schools announced it will reconsider its mask-optional policy, DeSantis, through his press secretary, hinted at calling a special session of the state Legislature to protect children against mask mandates., \"Many school boards are making the decision to go mask-optional, which is the right decision from our perspective. However, if Miami-Dade County Public Schools does decide to mandate masks, I\'d just refer you back to Governor DeSantis\' comments from the literacy presser last week: He hinted that the state legislature could do a special session to ensure a normal, mask-optional school year,\" spokesperson Christina Pushaw said in a statement to CNN., Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho said the district will announce its final decision on masks about two weeks before school starts on August 23., Doctor: \'We\'re becoming victims of the unvaccinated\', Some states are seeing consequences unfold., In Louisiana, a Baton Rouge medical center said that because it needs to divert staff to treat a crush of Covid-19 patients, it is de-prioritizing other care. , Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center said this week it halted the scheduling of non-urgent surgical procedures that would require a patient stay., \"We\'re becoming victims of the unvaccinated,\" Dr. Christopher Thomas, a critical care physician at the medical center, told CNN\'s \"Newsroom\" on Friday. , \"We currently are overwhelming our bed capacity. We\'re creating burnout for our teams. And honestly, we\'re beginning to impact the health care of the rest of the community,\" he said., About 140 Covid-19 patients were at Our Lady of the Lake as of Thursday, 30 of whom had been admitted over the previous 24 hours -- the most since the pandemic began, according to a hospital spokesperson., About 97% of the hospital\'s intensive-care patients Friday morning were unvaccinated, Thomas said., Louisiana\'s vaccination rate is among the lowest in the country, with just 37% of residents fully vaccinated as of Thursday, according to CDC data. , In Hawaii, the governor is considering travel restrictions. , Since last month, travelers who are fully vaccinated have been able to take domestic flights to Hawaii without having to be tested for the coronavirus, with no restrictions between islands. The state went into a virtual travel lockdown in the early weeks of the Covid pandemic, costing the state hundreds of millions of dollars in tourism revenue., State health director Dr. Libby Char said cases are rising and Gov. David Ige said it might be necessary to limit travel., \"I can assure you, at the point that I believe the hospitals have more patients than they would be able to handle, then we would take specific actions to restrict movements again,\" Ige said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/30/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html',1,5),(5,'Ob-gyn associations recommend all pregnant people get vaccinated against Covid-19','Two leading organizations that represent obstetricians and gynecologists recommended Friday that anyone who is pregnant should be vaccinated against Covid-19. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) said their recommendation is based on evidence from thousands of people who were pregnant that the vaccines are safe to be used during pregnancy. The associations also cite the country\'s low vaccination rate and the recent increase in cases., The associations are also strongly recommending their members \"enthusiastically recommend vaccination\" to their patients. , \"It is clear that pregnant people need to feel confident in the decision to choose vaccination, and a strong recommendation from their obstetrician--gynecologist could make a meaningful difference for many pregnant people,\" said Dr. J. Martin Tucker, the president of ACOG. \"Pregnant individuals should feel confident that choosing COVID-19 vaccination not only protects them, but also protects their families and communities.\", The groups had previously said Covid-19 vaccines \"should not be withheld\" from someone because they are pregnant, but did not recommend they get one. Now, there is a growing body of research that shows the vaccines are safe and effective., ACOG and SMFM have posted information online to help members navigate vaccine conversations. , The ACOG guide reminds providers that the willingness to consider vaccination varies by patient; it counsels providers to be aware of historic injustices and systematic racism in the health care profession, and to actively listen and validate concerns and fears., ACOG also recommends providers continue to care for patients who decide not to be vaccinated and to share resources and encourage the use of prevention methods such as physical distancing and masks., Neither association recommends one vaccine over the other; however, people who are pregnant should be made aware of the risk of rare blood clots with the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine., A Covid-19 infection puts pregnant women at an increased risk of severe complications, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The World Health Organization has said the same. And there\'s a concern that the risk may be even higher with the Delta strain, which is more contagious., Covid-19 also increases the risk of a preterm birth and may cause other adverse pregnancy outcomes, studies have shown. The guidelines say pregnant women who wait to get vaccinated after their delivery may inadvertently be exposing themselves to an increased risk of severe illness or death. , As the Delta variant of Covid-19 is dominating cases worldwide, several of England\'s top health officials issued a joint statement Friday that also urged pregnant women to get vaccinated. They pointed to new data that showed that 98% of expectant mothers admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 since May were unvaccinated. The latest data from the UK showed the number of pregnant women admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 has been increasing., The CDC does not directly recommend the vaccine, but it does say that pregnant women can receive the vaccine., \"Getting vaccinated in a personal choice,\" the CDC website says. The CDC does recommended that women who are trying to decide if they should get a Covid-19 vaccine should consider their risk of exposure, the risk of severe illness, the known benefits of vaccination, and the limited but growing evidence about the safety of vaccinations during pregnancy. , The CDC\'s systems that monitor for safety issues have not identified any safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or for their babies.  , So far, the vaccines appear to be equally effective in pregnant individuals. The vaccines offer strong protection against hospitalization and death. , And there is a growing body of research that shows that protective antibodies generated by the vaccine are passed on to the fetus. There is no current Covid-19 vaccines for an infant.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/30/health/pregnant-covid-vaccine-recommendation-wellness/index.html',1,6),(6,'How does the new CDC mask guidance change how families stay safe from Covid-19? An expert\'s take','The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance on Tuesday that recommended a return to indoor masking, even for vaccinated people, in parts of the country with One reason for the change in guidance is growing evidence that vaccinated people may also be able to infect others with the Delta variant of the coronavirus. Therefore, CDC officials advised people who live at home with unvaccinated children or immunocompromised family members to take particular caution and mask in indoor spaces., Many people have questions about what this CDC guidance means for families. Who should be masking and under what circumstances? What if parents have to go to work -- do they need to be wearing masks around their kids? Can grandparents still safely see their grandchildren? Should extended family get tested for Covid-19 prior to getting together -- even those who are vaccinated? , To help us make sense of all of this in the midst of changing guidance, we turned to CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She\'s also author of a new book, \"Lifelines: A Doctor\'s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.\", , CNN: What does the new CDC guidance mean in terms of who should be wearing masks and when?, Dr. Leana Wen: The way I understand the new CDC guidance is that there is one group that needs to take particular care in a way that\'s different from previous guidance., Previously, the CDC said that vaccinated people are well protected from severe illness and are not likely to spread the virus to others. Therefore, prior guidance indicated they don\'t need to be wearing masks. On the other hand, the unvaccinated are not protected. Especially with the more contagious Delta variant circulating, unvaccinated people are at high risk for contracting Covid-19 and transmitting the virus. They should be wearing masks when indoors., This remains true with the new guidance. The CDC is now saying that people who are vaccinated should wear masks indoors, too, particularly if they live at home with people who are unvaccinated or immunocompromised. , , My takeaway from this guidance is that these people -- and I am one of them, with two children under the age of 12 who are not yet eligible for the vaccine -- are at elevated risk because of the possibility of passing along Covid-19 to those we live with. We are still well protected ourselves from severe outcomes of coronavirus, but we want to reduce our risk by masking indoors to protect the vulnerable people in our family., CNN: A lot of grandparents are now wondering if they need to be extra careful to avoid infecting their grandkids. Can grandparents still safely see their unvaccinated grandchildren?, Wen: Yes -- though I think it\'s a good idea for people who will be around vulnerable, unvaccinated individuals to be cautious and to try to reduce their risk, especially if they are in an area of high coronavirus transmission. That means wearing masks, limiting time in crowded, indoor settings, and recognizing that risk is additive -- meaning that if you choose to engage in one high-risk activity, such as going to a large wedding with unvaccinated guests, you should try to reduce other high-risk exposures to cut your overall risk., I want to clarify that the vaccines are still very effective, but they are not 100%. An analogy I like is that the vaccines are a great raincoat. They\'ll protect you in a drizzle and even in a moderate rainstorm. But if you are in daily thunderstorms, at some point, you will get wet., , There are parts of the country that are in a drizzle. The level of vaccination in the community is high and infection rate is low. The chance of your encountering an asymptomatic, infected person is low, and if you\'re vaccinated, the risk of you contracting Covid-19 and then being infectious to your grandchildren is very low. If you live in such an area, you can probably go about your normal daily activities without much worry that you could somehow bring coronavirus to your family., That\'s different if you\'re in a community that\'s undergoing a major surge of cases. Where vaccination rates are low and infections are high, you have a higher likelihood of coming in contact with infected people. In those circumstances, the raincoat may not be enough -- maybe you need an umbrella, too. Think of the mask as that umbrella -- that additional layer of protection. , You may also want to reduce your exposure to other high-risk activities. I probably wouldn\'t be going to indoor bars and crowded gyms where other people around me are maskless. Reducing your risk of exposure will also reduce your likelihood of being an asymptomatic carrier who could bring Covid-19 to your unvaccinated grandkids., CNN: What about parents who work in jobs where they are exposed to unvaccinated, unmasked people? Should they wear a mask at home?, Wen: This is a tough situation. I hope that workplaces implement procedures to keep employees safe. Ideally, they should require proof of vaccination or at least regular testing. If not, they should still be implementing masking and physical distancing. , If you are in a situation where your workplace does not have these protocols, you can still try to keep yourself safe. That includes wearing an N95 or KN95 mask when indoors and in close quarters with others of unknown vaccination status. Try to avoid maskless gatherings when possible -- for example, eat lunch at your desk instead of around others. If possible, raise your concerns with your supervisor and see if you could be reassigned a workspace away from others or if you could at least try to avoid crowded conference rooms., I think it\'s really hard for parents to continuously wear masks in their own homes around their children -- except in very specific, time-limited situations, like if they have symptoms or are awaiting a coronavirus test. The best thing to do is to try to reduce risk at work as much as possible., , CNN: If an extended family is getting together, what\'s safe? Let\'s say that some are vaccinated, and some are not., Wen: The safest thing to do is to get together outdoors only. In that case, no one needs to be masked or get tested., If indoor get-togethers are planned with a group of mixed vaccination status, ideally everyone should quarantine and then get tested. With the Delta variant surging, this is the safest option to help keep families safe., There is a lot changing with the CDC guidance. We need to do our best to reduce our risk while also resuming parts of our lives that are the most important. Vaccination remains the best way to protect ourselves and our loved ones.

So the more Delta is infectious, the more reason for concern,\" Kondrashov told reporters., \"By having a situation where you vaccinate everybody, a vaccine-resistant mutant actually gains a selective advantage.\", On Tuesday, the US CDC altered its guidance on mask use. The CDC said earlier this year that fully vaccinated people are very safe from infection and can take off their masks in most situations., Now, it says even fully vaccinated people can sometimes catch the virus and if they catch the Delta variant, they are just as likely to infect someone else as an unvaccinated person would be. It advised everyone in areas of high or sustained virus transmission to wear masks when around others. , Many GOP politicians have derided the new advice. On Thursday, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves called it \"foolish.\", While the CDC was not thinking about the evolution of variants, Kondrashov said people skeptical of maintaining vigilance should be., \"The individual who already vaccinated and putting on a mask should not think this is pointless but should think that there is a vaccine resistant strain running around,\" he said., \"By preventing spread of vaccine resistant strains, you are preventing evolution of this virus,\" he added.  , \"We have two tools in our toolbox to do this. One is non pharmaceutical interventions such as mask wearing and the whole shebang, and the second is vaccines.

No deaths were reported among them., About 74% -- or 346 cases -- had been fully vaccinated. Of those cases, 79% reported symptoms. Genetically sequenced cases revealed the Delta variant as the main culprit., The researchers found evidence that viral loads were similar among 127 fully vaccinated people and 84 others who were unvaccinated, partially vaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown. Viral load is a proxy for how likely someone might be to transmit the virus to others. , On Tuesday, Walensky previewed these findings while unveiling guidance that people in areas with \"high\" or \"substantial\" Covid-19 transmission should resume wearing masks indoors. Over 75% of the US population live in these areas. , The finding that the Delta variant resulted in similar viral loads \"was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC\'s updated mask recommendation,\" Walensky said Friday. , \"The masking recommendation was updated to ensure the vaccinated public would not unknowingly transmit virus to others, including their unvaccinated or immunocompromised loved ones.\", Questions remain, Prior to Delta, vaccination was known to impact factors that likely influence transmission. Not only did vaccinated people tend to have lower viral loads, but they also had milder symptoms and were sick for less time., But research has shown that Delta spreads more aggressively. Earlier this month, for example, Chinese scientists described viral loads that were about roughly 1,000 times higher with Delta than earlier strains., On Thursday, a CDC internal document said the Delta variant was roughly as transmissible as as chickenpox, whereas an early strain was closer to the common cold. This means that, under certain conditions, an infected person may have transmitted to two or three people, on average, early in the outbreak. But now, with Delta, that number could be five to nine., \"It\'s one of the most transmissible viruses we know about. Measles, chickenpox, this -- they\'re all up there,\" Walensky told CNN late Thursday., The CDC document also cited reports indicating the variant might cause more severe disease, as well., But even with similar viral loads, it\'s not a foregone conclusion that vaccinated people are necessarily as contagious as unvaccinated people., \"This is intriguing data, it\'s important, but I\'m not positive that you\'re equally as infectious if you\'re vaccinated,\" said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist at University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the research., Gandhi said there are multiple parts to the immune system -- including antibodies and T cells -- that raise important questions around using viral load, which is measured by PCR tests, as a proxy for how contagious someone is., The new report says that \"microbiological studies are required to confirm these findings\" of similar viral loads among breakthrough infections. It also notes that \"asymptomatic breakthrough infections might be underrepresented\" because they are less likely to be detected., Earlier this week, Walensky said that ongoing outbreak investigations will help uncover more about what happens when these breakthrough infections do occur., \"We are now continuing to follow those clusters to understand the impact of forward transmission of those vaccinated people,\" she said. \"But again, I want to reiterate, we believe the vast majority of transmission is occurring in unvaccinated people and through unvaccinated people.\", Even more reason to get vaccinated, Even with Delta, Covid-19 vaccines still reduce the spread of the virus. Moreover, vaccinated people are far less likely to end up in the hospital., The CDC internal document estimated that vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease or death 10-fold or greater, and they reduce the risk of infection three-fold., \"Getting vaccinated continues to prevent severe illness, hospitalization and death -- even with Delta,\" Walensky said this week. , Among the Massachusetts residents in the latest study, none died and only five were hospitalized., Of those five, one person was unvaccinated and had underlying medical conditions, and four were vaccinated. Among the vaccinated group, one had received the Pfizer vaccine, and the remaining three had received Johnson &amp; Johnson. The vaccinated individuals ranged in age from 20 to 70, and two had underlying health conditions., Additional infections were identified among visitors from at least 22 other states who visited the area from July 3 through 17. Thousands gathered for summer festivities, and infected people reported going to \"densely packed indoor and outdoor events at venues that included bars, restaurants, guest houses, and rental homes,\" the study says. , Although these findings motivated CDC to update its guidance for areas with higher levels of viral transmission, the study notes that Barnstable County was not one of those areas until the outbreak. Between July 3 and 17, daily new cases rose from a 14-day average of 0 to 177 cases per 100,000 residents., The study suggests that \"even jurisdictions without substantial or high COVID-19 transmission might consider expanding prevention strategies, including masking in indoor public settings regardless of vaccination status.\", \"The measures we need to get this under control -- they\'re extreme. The measures you need are extreme,\" Walensky told CNN late Thursday., The study also notes that breakthrough infections are expected, especially as the slice of the population that\'s vaccinated grows larger. \"As population-level vaccination coverage increases, vaccinated persons are likely to represent a larger proportion of COVID-19 cases,\" the authors wrote., CNN previously reported on the outbreak connected to Provincetown. In total, at least 882 cases have been linked to the cluster so far, about 60% of whom were Massachusetts residents, according to local officials., The town manager of Provincetown, Alex Morse, told CNN Friday that the town appeared to be taking a favorable turn -- with an indoor mask mandate in place and a test positivity rate that\'s on the decline., \"We think we\'re heading in the right direction, but obviously concerned about what\'s happened here in the last few weeks,\" Morse told CNN\'s John Berman., A source familiar with the CDC\'s decision to update its recommendations previously told CNN that, in addition to the viral load findings, the overall prevalence of Delta and lower-than-hoped vaccine uptake played key roles in the latest iteration of the guidance.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/30/health/breakthrough-infection-masks-cdc-provincetown-study/index.html',1,12),(11,'What\'s different about the Delta variant? Here\'s what\'s known','The US has done an about-face on its approach to the coronavirus pandemic this week. Masks are back, vaccine mandates are looming, and officials are sounding more worried than they have in months.President Joe Biden said Thursday that every federal government employee or contractor would be asked to say whether they are vaccinated, and those who are not must wear a mask on the job, keep their distance from others and submit to a virus test at least once a week., Driving this are two things: The large number of Americans who remain unvaccinated, and the rapid spread of the Delta variant., Here\'s what\'s known so far about the variant., What the Delta variant is, The Delta variant, originally known as B.1.617.2, has been around since late last year but in recent months it has become speedily dominant in many countries. It accounts for more than 80% of newly diagnosed cases in the US, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. , \"COVID-19 cases have increased over 300% nationally from June 19 to July 23, 2021, along with parallel increases in hospitalizations and deaths driven by the highly transmissible B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant,\" the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a Health Alert Network advisory this week., The Delta variant is more transmissible, How much more is not really clear. Estimates range from 60% more to more than 200% more, depending on who is doing the estimates., One CDC document indicates the Delta variant is about as transmissible as chickenpox -- with each infected person infecting as many as eight or nine others, on average. The original strain of coronavirus, the CDC indicated was about as contagious as the common cold, with each infected person infecting two others., It\'s a difficult number to check, because figuring that out would require much more testing than is being done now. People who test positive would have to submit samples for genomic sequencing, and that\'s only done in a few places in the US., And to compare its transmissibility to past variants would require that kind of testing to have been done in past months -- and that simply was not done., So everything relies on estimates., , British infectious disease modelers, a group known as the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group, say the data indicate the Delta is 40-60% more transmissible than the B.1.1.7 or Alpha variant, which was once the dominant strain in the US but which has been replaced by Delta. They say it\'s almost twice as transmissible as the original strains of the virus first seen in China., Delta may cause more serious disease, Hospital emergency rooms and intensive care units are filling up with patients again in parts of the US. It may look like the Delta variant is making people sicker, but more than 90% of people showing up for treatment are unvaccinated, according to the CDC and hospital officials who have spoken to CNN., So while people may be more likely to become infected in the first place with Delta if they are unvaccinated, there\'s no hard data yet showing that Delta causes more serious disease., The CDC cites three older studies, from Canada, Singapore and Scotland, indicating people infected with Delta end up in the hospital more often., What is also happening is that younger people are making up a larger share of those getting sick. More than 80% of Americans over 65 are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. But younger Americans are not vaccinated at the same rate, so they\'re the ones showing up in ERs., It may be more able to infect even fully vaccinated people, No vaccine is 100% effective, and many thousands of people who are fully vaccinated have nonetheless become infected -- something known as a breakthrough case., The CDC released a startling study Friday looking at an outbreak in Provincetown, Massachusetts where 74% of people who got infected had been fully vaccinated -- and four of them ended up in the hospital., The outbreak involved 469 people who caught Covid earlier this month., \"Testing identified the Delta variant in 90% of specimens from 133 patients,\" the researchers from the CDC and local health departments wrote in the CDC\'s weekly report., It\'s the first big study to contradict earlier evidence that vaccinated people are almost completely safe from serious disease, even involving Delta and other variants., This was noted in a CDC presentation made to Walensky this week., \"Vaccines prevent  more than 90% of severe disease, but may be less effective at preventing infection or transmission,\" it reads. \"Therefore, more breakthrough and more community spread despite vaccination.\", The CDC now notes this on its website., \"Available evidence suggests the currently authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are highly effective against hospitalization and death for a variety of strains, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2),\" the CDC says., , , , \"Data suggest lower effectiveness against confirmed infection and symptomatic disease caused by the Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants compared with the ancestral strain and Alpha variant. Ongoing monitoring of vaccine effectiveness against variants is needed,\" the CDC adds., Tests done in lab dishes had indicated the immune response generated by vaccines should be, in theory, strong and broad enough to cover Delta. , , It may be more infectious in breakthrough cases than past strains, While the CDC originally told people that the vaccinated are less likely to infect others, CDC\'s Walensky said this week the Delta variant may be different., The Provincetown study released Friday shows that. \"Persons with COVID-19 reported attending densely packed indoor and outdoor events at venues that included bars, restaurants, guest houses, and rental homes,\" the researchers wrote., Tests on the infected people showed the fully vaccinated had as much virus in their bodies as unvaccinated people did., \"High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus. This finding is concerning and was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC\'s updated mask recommendation,\" Walensky said in a statement., Because of this and other evidence, the CDC now says even vaccinated people should wear masks in areas of sustained or high transmission. It\'s because vaccinated people may get exposed and then may have enough virus growing in their bodies to infect someone else, even if they don\'t have symptoms., \"Findings from this investigation suggest that even jurisdictions without substantial or high COVID-19 transmission might consider expanding prevention strategies, including masking in indoor public settings regardless of vaccination status, given the potential risk of infection during attendance at large public gatherings that include travelers from many areas with differing levels of transmission,\" the team reporting on the Provincetown outbreak wrote., A lot of what is known comes from one study done by researchers in China., They found viral loads of people infected with Delta were 1,000 times higher than people infected at the very beginning of the pandemic., Jing Lu of the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention and colleagues also said the virus transmitted more quickly -- in four days, compared to six days at the beginning of the pandemic., People who make back-of-the-envelope statements about Delta\'s properties are often referring to this single study. For instance, New York University infectious disease specialist Dr. Celine Gounder created a stir when she said people could be infected by Delta in just one second of exposure, compared to 15 minutes at the beginning of the pandemic., This wasn\'t based on scientific observations. Gounder was extrapolating from Lu\'s study, she explained on Twitter., It has some unique mutations, The Delta strain has a constellation of mutations that mark it., Each variant carries a cluster of different mutations. When these mutations start to make a particular lineage of virus behave differently or have different effects, it gets tagged as a variant of concern or a variant of interest., Delta has at least three mutations on a structure that is called the receptor binding domain -- the part of the virus that directly docks into the human cells it infects. They may help it escape detection by the immune system and at least one of them may help it bind more tightly to cells., Another mutation in a place known as the furin cleavage site -- it\'s on the characteristic spike protein -- might also help make the virus infect cells more easily, according to the American Society of Microbiology., \"The mutation is thought to increase viral infectivity and transmissibility; however, research indicates that it must occur on the background of additional spike protein mutations in order to be consequential,\" the ASM says., It doesn\'t have some of the mutations that made other variants more transmissible, including one called N501Y that characterizes the Alpha or B.1.1.7 variant; the Beta or B.1.351 variant; and the Gamma or P1 variant. It also lacks a mutation called E484K seen in Beta and Gamma., The answer to the spread, infectious disease experts universally say, is more vaccination. \"If we have more and more people vaccinated, we will win in this race,\" Walensky said this week.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/30/health/delta-variant-covid-19-questions-answered/index.html',1,14),(12,'\'I am furious with myself\': Unvaccinated Covid patient describes the exhausting illness','Sitting in her hospital room in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Aimee Matzen struggled to breathe as she described how exhausting it is to have , \"The fact that I am here now, I am furious with myself,\" she told CNN between deep, deliberate breaths. \"Because I was not vaccinated.\" , Matzen, 44, finds herself in the Covid-19 intensive care unit at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge. She is receiving oxygen treatments and hopes she stays well enough to avoid getting hooked up to a ventilator., With Covid-19 surging in states across the country, Louisiana stands among those hardest hit by the most recent rise in cases, driven in large part by the Delta variant. , The state has the highest 7-day average of new cases per-capita in the country, at 77 cases reported per 100,000 residents each day over the past week, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University., \"It is a kick in the gut to feel like we effectively have lost six or seven months of progress,\" Louisiana State Health Officer Dr. Joseph Kanter told CNN\'s John King on Wednesday., , Kanter attributed the surge to a \"perfect storm\" of factors, including the Delta variant, which is believed to be more transmissible, and \"unacceptably low vaccination coverage.\", Louisiana\'s vaccination rate is among the lowest in the country, with just 37% of residents fully vaccinated as of Wednesday, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Our Lady of Lake is the largest regional medical center in the state, she said. But it doesn\'t have the staff to treat everyone., Patients are coming in waves, O\'Neal told CNN, forcing the hospital to call in reserve workers and shut down other wards., \"The load is becoming overwhelming,\" she said., There were 140 Covid-19 patients at Our Lady of the Lake as of Thursday, 30 of whom had been admitted over the previous 24 hours -- the most since the pandemic began, according to a hospital spokesperson., Almost 50% of the patients are under age 50.

Even outside, \"there is no more safe,\" she said. , \"If you\'re interacting in this community, you should be vaccinated and you should have a mask on, because we\'re inundated with Covid,\" she said. , Another patient at Our Lady of the Lake, Carsyn Baker, said she believed she got the virus when she visited her friend\'s house for her birthday, sitting on a screened porch. , \"I\'d close my eyes and I\'d feel like I couldn\'t breathe,\" Baker, 21, said. \"Something in my body would tell me, like, \'hey, you need to breathe, like, wake up.\'\" , Baker has a kidney condition, she said, and her doctor has advised against her getting vaccinated for now.  , \"It kind of sucks because people like myself with an auto-immune disease, you can\'t really go anywhere now, because everybody\'s getting sick and it just don\'t matter what you do,\" Baker said., , Ronnie Smith, another patient, was considering getting a vaccine.

They still save lives. They still prevent hospitalizations at a remarkably high rate,\" he added., Over the past seven days, the rate of Americans getting their first vaccine shots has gone up. It was 35% higher than the previous seven-day period and the highest it has been in three weeks, according to CNN analysis of CDC data., But vaccination rates are still not so high as to get enough of the US inoculated against the virus to slow or stop its spread, experts have said.

Both diseases have been marked by inflammation of the brain. , Dr. Gabriel de Erausquin, a professor of neurology at the University of Texas Health Science Center, and colleagues studied more than 200 adults 60 and older from Argentina who were infected with Covid-19., Those who had a persistent loss of smell were more likely to experience cognitive issues, they told the Alzheimer\'s Association International Conference., , Three to six months after they were infected, more than half of the patients still struggled with forgetfulness and about a quarter experienced additional cognitive challenges. How sick a patient was with Covid-19 was not an indicator of whether they would experience cognitive decline., \"The severity of the initial disease does not predict who is going to get this,\" Erausquin told CNN. \"In fact, many of them had minimal symptoms -- just a cold or loss of smell.\" , The cognitive issues --including persistent forgetfulness, difficulty sequencing tasks, and forgetting words and phrases -- are similar to those seen in Alzheimer\'s patients. Erausquin noted that the parts of the brain responsible for sense of smell overlap with those impacted by Alzheimer\'s disease., He noted that the cognitive symptoms his team observed appear to be distinct from the \"brain fog,\" associated with long-term symptoms of Covid-19, sometimes seen in younger patients., \"Brain fog in younger individuals has a different flavor, if you will,\" Erausquin said. \"They have more attentional problems, more concentration problems, and frequently have more anxiety and depression.\", It\'s too soon to tell whether the cognitive issues will worsen over time -- as they would in Alzheimer\'s patients -- or if these patients will recover, Erausquin said., Biological Markers linked to Alzheimer\'s, In additional research presented at the conference, Dr. Thomas Wisniewski, a professor of neurology at New York University Grossman School of Medicine, and colleagues found that Covid-19 patients over the age of 60 had biological blood markers also found in Alzheimer\'s patients., Among 310 Covid-19 patients admitted to New York University Langone Health, the team found that those with neurological symptoms had higher levels of biomarkers linked to Alzheimer\'s. Those biomarkers include a protein called tau that\'s been linked with Alzheimer\'s and other compounds known as neurofilament light -- an indicator of damage to nerve cells -- and others., \"These findings suggest that patients who had COVID-19 may have an acceleration of Alzheimer\'s-related symptoms and pathology,\" Wisniewski said in a statement., , Wisniewski said more research is needed to understand how those biomarkers affect long-term cognition in people who were infected with Covid-19., \"Those are the kinds of things that make you suspicious that indeed there may be an overlap with  Alzheimer\'s disease, of some sort,\" Erausquin said. \"But it\'s very early in the game.

But what do \"substantial\" and \"high\" actually mean?The two terms are part of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s four-tiered system that measures the level of community transmission in each county: low, moderate, substantial and high. On the CDC\'s website, you can run a search by state or county and click around the color-coded map to see how active the virus is where you live.  , A county\'s level of transmission is based on just two metrics: new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people and the positivity rate, both measured over the last seven days. The basic idea is that these show how much virus is spreading around us, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen said., \"The level of coronavirus transmission is an important determinant of how much risk you\'re in, if you\'re vaccinated or unvaccinated,\" she said., Specifically, a \"Low\" transmission is considered no more than 10 cases per 100,000 people, or a test positivity rate of less than 5%. \"Moderate\" transmission is 10 to 50 cases per 100,000 people, or a positivity rate between 5% and 8%. \"Substantial\" transmission is 50 to 100 cases per 100,000, or a positivity rate between 8% and 10%, and \"high\" transmission is 100 or more cases per 100,000 people or a positivity rate of 10% or higher., If a county has values in two different transmission levels, then the CDC uses the metric that is higher., On the CDC\'s map, low counties are represented in blue, moderate counties are in yellow, substantial counties are in orange and high counties are in red. Counties vary in size so it\'s also a good idea to check a city, state or municipal health department website., As of Wednesday, about 50% of counties have high transmission and 17% have substantial transmission, which covers wide swaths of the South and West, according to CDC data. About 27% of US counties are considered to have moderate transmission and only about 9% have low transmission., Health officials say this new guidance, an update from May, reflects the latest science on the more transmissible Delta variant and evidence that suggests vaccinated people can still spread the virus. The vast majority of spread still appears to come from unvaccinated people, who are at much higher risk of severe illness that can send people to the hospital or kill them., The guidance on mask wearing is meant to remind people who are fully vaccinated that they might be able to infect others, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday., The strengths and weaknesses of the CDC\'s system, Several medical experts took issue with parts of the CDC\'s decision to update the mask guidance and its specific metrics., For one, the CDC\'s system solely is based on new cases and positivity rate -- but not vaccinations, hospitalizations, deaths or any of the other relevant metrics experts have come to know since the pandemic began., \"If you were to ask me how I define a community that has high transmission, I say, \'I don\'t look at any one number,\'\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine. \"I don\'t look at positivity rate, the per-100,000 rate, I don\'t look at hospitalizations or deaths. I look at it all in aggregate to really get a sense of what\'s happening on a really high level.\", Hotez also took issue with the CDC using 100 cases per 100,000 people as a \"high\" level of transmission, which he said was a low bar. As cases continue to rise in the coming few weeks, the CDC\'s map is likely to become less useful, he said., \"Everything is going to be red pretty soon, and that\'s not good either because it doesn\'t give you a lot of credit for vaccinations,\" he said., Wen noted that the CDC\'s metrics don\'t take into account an area\'s vaccination rate., \"I wish that the CDC had tied indoor mask wearing to vaccination rates in a community. That\'s something people can work towards, and it\'s something that\'s less arbitrary,\" she said., \"It\'s also more motivating as an incentive,\" she added., Further, both case rates and positivity rate are based on the amount of testing in a community, and it\'s not clear whether the US is doing so at a sufficient level., \"I don\'t think we\'re doing a good job of measuring how much spread is actually underway in this country,\" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said on NPR\'s \"Morning Edition\" on Wednesday. \"I think we have far more spread than what we\'re picking up.\" , The US is not doing a lot of testing, he said, and much of the testing done is at home and not being reported to local authorities. And many people who are getting infected now or experiencing mild symptoms are not seeking out tests., \"Generally speaking, the people who are presenting for testing are either people who are getting very sick, or people who are developing telltale symptoms of Covid like loss of taste or smell,\" he said. \"So, we\'re picking up probably a very small fraction of the overall infections.\", Wen was similarly skeptical of the level of testing in some parts of the US, saying she believed the US could be under-testing., \"I\'m not sure that total number of cases paints the most accurate picture, but it\'s at least a reasonable proxy,\" she said., Still, her main problem with the CDC\'s guidance was that it missed the basic point of this phase of the pandemic -- getting people vaccinated., \"The main problem is not the vaccinated, it\'s the unvaccinated. Let\'s not get this backwards here,\" she said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/health/substantial-or-high-covid-19-transmission-wellness/index.html',1,26),(20,'Pfizer data suggest third dose of Covid-19 vaccine \'strongly\' boosts protection against Delta variant','A third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine can \"strongly\" boost protection against the Delta variant -- beyond the protection afforded by the standard two doses, The data posted online suggest that levels of antibodies that can target the Delta variant  grow fivefold in people 18 to 55 who get a third dose of the vaccine., Among people ages 65 to 85, the Pfizer data suggest that antibody levels that should protect against Delta grow 11-fold more than following a second dose., The data, which involved tests of 23 people, have not yet been peer-reviewed or published., It\'s not clear if boosted antibody levels actually correlate to better protection, or if that extra protection is even needed. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current vaccines protect people well against all the common variants., During a company earnings call on Wednesday morning, Dr. Mikael Dolsten, who leads worldwide research, development and medical for Pfizer, called the new data on a third dose of vaccine \"encouraging.\", \"Receiving a third dose more than six months after vaccination, when protection may be beginning to wane, was estimated to potentially boost the neutralizing antibody titers in participants in this study to up to 100 times higher post-dose three compared to pre-dose three,\" Dolsten said in prepared remarks. \"These preliminary data are very encouraging as Delta continues to spread.\", The data also show that antibody levels are much higher against the original coronavirus variant and the Beta variant, first identified in South Africa, after a third dose. , , , Separately, Pfizer and its partner BioNtech released new safety and efficacy data for their coronavirus vaccine Wednesday, and said it shows protection holds up for at least six months, although it may start to wane slightly towards the end of that time., The pre-print paper, posted Wednesday to the online server medrxiv.org, updates results from Pfizer\'s trial involving 44,000 volunteers around the world., It found the overall efficacy was about 91% during the six months. Vaccine efficacy against severe Covid-19 was about 97%, the data show. The paper has not yet been peer-reviewed nor published in a journal., The data show that the vaccine\'s efficacy peaked at more than 96% from a week to around two months after receiving a second dose of vaccine, and then appeared to gradually decline to 83.7% four to six months later, with an average decline of about 6% over the last two months., , Earlier this month, Pfizer announced it has seen waning immunity from its coronavirus vaccine, saying it is picking up its efforts to develop a third dose that will protect people from variants. The company also specified it would seek emergency use authorization under the US Food and Drug Administration for a third dose in August., But in an unusual move, the FDA and CDC said at the time Americans don\'t need third doses quite yet and that it was not up to companies alone to decide when an additional dose might be needed., US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy repeated that point Wednesday morning, telling CNN\'s Poppy Harlow, \"People do not need to go out and get a booster shot.\" , Also, there is much more to the immune system than antibodies., For instance, experts say it remains unclear how antibody levels correlate with real-world immunity, and to what extent other parts of the immune system -- such as B cells and T cells -- could factor into protection., Pfizer to submit third-dose vaccine data to FDA soon, Pfizer said it anticipates submitting data on a third dose of its coronavirus vaccine to the FDA as soon as next month, Dolsten said during Wednesday\'s earnings call., \"We are in ongoing discussions with regulatory agencies regarding a potential third-dose booster of the current vaccine and, assuming positive results, anticipate an emergency use authorization submission as early as August,\" Dolsten said., , In order for third doses to be administered to people in the United States, the emergency use authorization that the FDA issued for the vaccine would either need to be amended or, if the vaccine were fully FDA approved, a third dose could be given off label., \"We continue to believe it is likely that a third-dose booster may be needed within six to 12 months after full vaccination to maintain the highest level of protection, and studies are underway to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a third dose,\" Dolsten said, adding that data suggest antibody levels appear to decline around eight months after receiving a second dose of vaccine., \"Pending regulatory approval, we also plan to start an immunogenicity and safety study in August to evaluate an updated version of our vaccine specifically designed to target the Delta variant,\" Dolsten said. , He mentioned how the Delta variant is the \"most transmissible\" yet seen and now represents about 83% of sequenced Covid-19 cases in the United States., Surgeon general: \'People do not need to go out and get a booster shot\', At this point, the decision on if and when booster shots are necessary will be made by agencies such as the FDA and CDC, Murthy said on CNN on Wednesday., \"This data from Pfizer, we\'ve been in talks with them about what they\'re seeing with regard to their studies related to boosters,\" Murthy said, when asked about Pfizer\'s new data. \"But at this point, I want to be very clear: People do not need to go out and get a booster shot.\" , Murthy said government agencies would be \"looking at the whole breadth of data that will come from companies, that will come from cohorts that the CDC is now following, where they\'re tracking whether or not there is any waning in immunity or increase in breakthrough rates., \"Ultimately, that collective information is what will drive any decision about boosters.\",  , Murthy also said that the question of whether it was ethical for a third booster shot to be recommended while there is a major vaccine supply shortage in the developing world was a \"critical question\" because the ability to reduce the likelihood of future variants  depends on tamping down spread of the virus around the world., \"We as a country have a vested interest in getting the rest of the world vaccinated,\" Murthy said. \"It\'s one of the reasons why we don\'t want to have to choose between giving our population boosters, if it\'s required, and vaccinating the rest of the world.\" , This is why the United States is making sure it is increasing manufacturing capacity in other countries, he said, working with vaccine companies such as Pfizer and Moderna to ensure they are producing more for the rest of the world and donating excess supply to other countries.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/health/pfizer-third-dose-data-bn/index.html',1,27),(21,'US surgeon general says putting a mask back on will help, but vaccinations will stonewall the pandemic','While people putting their masks back on indoors will help reduce the spread of \"The bottom line is the masks will help us reduce spread further, but the vaccinations remain the bedrock of ending this pandemic,\" Murthy told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer., The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its mask guidance Tuesday to recommend fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas with \"substantial\" or \"high\" transmission of Covid-19 -- more than half of all US counties., \"What\'s really important, also, is to say what has not changed,\" Murthy said. \"And what has not changed is that vaccines still work. They still save lives. They still prevent hospitalizations at a remarkably high rate.\", Much of the country remains unvaccinated, despite incentive programs and urging from health experts. Only 49.2% of the US population is fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. More than 34.6 million people in the United States have tested positive for the coronavirus. , Murthy said he doesn\'t want Americans to think the new mask guidelines mean that progress against Covid-19 is lost., \"That is not the case,\" he said, adding that vaccines have prevented many hospitalizations and deaths., Dr. Anthony Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the situation could have been different., \"If we had the overwhelming proportion of the people vaccinated, we would not be having this conversation,\" he told PBS. , Fauci addressed the changing guidance from the CDC, which in mid-May said most fully vaccinated people don\'t have to wear masks indoors or outdoors., \"We are dealing with an evasive type of a virus. It evolves,\" Fauci said. \"People need to understand. It\'s a painful realization, but it\'s true. We\'re dealing with a virus that\'s a wily character.\", The CDC\'s May guidance was based on the Alpha coronavirus variant being dominant, he and Murthy said. It no longer is, so the CDC isn\'t flip-flopping, Fauci said; it\'s keeping up with the changing science., The CDC updated the \"When You\'ve Been Fully Vaccinated\" section of its website on Tuesday., , Change to masking guidance based on new data, The guidance change also included the recommendation that everyone in and around K-12 schools wear masks, even if they are fully vaccinated. , CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday on a telebriefing that the agency, through investigations of clusters of Covid-19 outbreaks, determined the Delta variant is more likely to infect even fully vaccinated people., \"What we\'ve learned in that context is that when we examine the rarer breakthrough infections, and we look at the amount of virus in those people, it is pretty similar to the amount of virus in unvaccinated people,\" Walensky said., She said the \"vast majority\" of transmission is through unvaccinated people., Nearly two-thirds of US counties have high or substantial transmission of Covid-19, according to CDC data; 46% of counties have high transmission and 17% have substantial transmission., The CDC defines high transmission as at least 100 new cases per 100,000 people or a test positivity rate of at least 10% in the past seven days. The threshold for substantial transmission is 50 new cases per 100,000 people or a test positivity rate of 8%., Schools are filled with unvaccinated people who can spread Covid-19 to other settings, former US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said., \"Schools are a large reservoir of unvaccinated people -- of superspreaders, if you will -- who can take the Delta variant home and to other places,\" Adams told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper., Adams said the risk of serious illness or death is low for children but the point is they also spread the virus to other people., Florida is one state unlikely to require masks in schools. Gov. Ron DeSantis, responding through a spokesperson to the CDC recommendations, said parents know what\'s best for their children., \"Fortunately, the data indicate that Covid is not a serious risk to healthy children, which is why schools in most countries were among the first institutions to reopen,\" said spokesperson Christina Pushaw. \"At the end of the day, the governor trusts parents to weigh the risks and benefits and make the best choices for their kids.\" , DeSantis\' statement is in contrast to CDC evidence that shows Covid-19 can be a serious risk to children. CDC data indicate more children have died from Covid-19 -- 517 so far -- than are killed by the flu annually, even in a bad influenza year. , There were reports of more than 38,600 new cases in children for the period between July 15 and 22, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics., Children have accounted for 1.3% to 3.6% of the hospitalizations, depending on the state, according to the organization, which represents pediatricians. , US could again see 200K Covid-19 cases daily, former CDC director says, The US could see nearly four times the current rate of Covid-19 cases in the next four to six weeks as the Delta variant spreads and the population hits a wall on vaccinations, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told CNN., , \"We\'re heading into a rough time. It\'s likely, if our trajectory is similar to that in the United Kingdom, that we could see as many as 200,000 cases a day,\" Dr. Tom Frieden said Monday, adding the US likely won\'t see the \"horrific death tolls\" of earlier in the pandemic thanks to the number of vulnerable people who are vaccinated. Frieden was CDC director during the Obama administration., But, he said, \"You will see a steady increase in deaths, and these are preventable deaths.\", Cases have jumped as the Delta variant has spread. , The US averaged more than 57,300 new daily cases over the last week -- an average that\'s generally risen since the country hit a 2021 low of 11,351 daily on June 22,  according to Johns Hopkins University data., As of Tuesday, cases have risen by 50% or more in 35 states over the past seven days compared to the week before. , The last time more than 200,000 US cases were reported in a day was in January, according to Johns Hopkins., The Delta variant is believed to be more transmissible than other strains -- so much so, Frieden said, that it is essentially finding people who are unvaccinated. , Vaccination rates have hit a wall, and that could have serious consequences, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia., \"Now we are at a point where there is a solid 25 or 30% of the population that\'s saying they don\'t want to get vaccinated, that they are okay with allowing this virus to continue to spread, continue to do harm and, worst of all, continue to possibly create variants that are going to be resistant to vaccine-induced immunity,\" Offit said., And vaccinated people will likely pay a price for those choices, CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen said. Even though vaccines offer strong protection against the virus, being surrounded by unvaccinated people could lead to infection spillover, and vaccinated people could get sick or pass on the infection to their loved ones, she said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/27/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html',1,28),(22,'How much do I need to sleep? It depends on your age','Do you find yourself dozing off at your desk, even after what you thought was a good night\'s rest? Then you probably have the same question as so many others: How much do I need to sleep? The answer of how many hours you need is not so straightforward, said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an assistant professor of clinical medicine in the division of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. , Sleep needs are very individualized, he said, but the general recommendation -- the \"sweet spot\" -- is to get seven to nine hours of sleep a night. Recommendations really change as people age, however., \"Sleep needs vary over the lifespan,\" said Christina Chick, a postdoctoral scholar in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University., CDC\'s sleep guideline, Adults should get at least seven hours of sleep a night, but 1 in 3 of them don\'t, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. , Poor sleep has been associated with long-term health consequences, such as higher risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and dementia. In the short term, even one day of sleep loss can harm your well-being, according to a recent study. People who get poor sleep might also be predisposed to conditions such as anxiety, depression and bipolar disorder, Dasgupta said., \"There are chronic consequences, and there are acute consequences, which is why sleep is more than just saying, \'The early bird gets the worm,\'\" he said. \"It\'s much more than that.\", Sleep for kids and teens, If it feels like babies are sleeping all day, they pretty much are. In the first year of life, babies can sleep 17 to 20 hours a day, Dasgupta said. Infants 4 months to 12 months need their 12 to 16 hours of sleep, including naps, according to Chick., Toddlers, who are between the ages of 1 and 3, should get 11 to 14 hours of sleep, according to Dr. Bhanu Kolla, associate professor of psychiatry and psychology at the Mayo Clinic with a special interest in sleep. Children ages 3 to 5 should sleep for 10 to 13 hours, he added, and from ages 6 to 12, they should sleep nine to 12 hours. For kids up to age 5, these sleep recommendations include naps, Chick said., Teenagers should get eight to 10 hours of sleep, Kolla said. This recommendation has sparked a debate in recent years about start times for school., \"As children move toward adolescence, they naturally prefer to go to sleep later and wake up later,\" Chick said. \"This is why school start times are such an important focus of debate: If you can\'t fall asleep until later, but your school start time remains the same, you\'re going to get less sleep.\" , The quantity of sleep is important, but so is the quality of it, Dasgupta added. , Getting deeper sleep and hitting the rapid eye movement (REM) stage helps with cognition, memory and productivity throughout the day. REM is the sleep stage where memories are consolidated and stored. It also allows us to dream vividly. People can sometimes get the right quantity of sleep but still feel fatigued, and this might mean they aren\'t reaching these sleep stages. , , \"We tend to underestimate the need, especially in teenagers, people going to high school, of how important sleep is,\" Dasgupta said., Sleep for college students and adults, The stereotypical image of the college student usually includes messy hair, undereye bags, and a coffee or energy drink in hand. It doesn\'t matter if they stay up all night partying or cramming for an exam -- both result in sleep deprivation. , \"It\'s unfortunate, but it\'s almost like a rite of passage in a college student to pull the perennial all-nighter even though we know that\'s not what you\'re supposed to do,\" Dasgupta said. , He and Kolla concur that seven to nine hours of sleep is best for adults, though Kolla added that older adults may be better at coping with some sleep deprivation. As an exception, young adults may need nine or more hours on a regular basis because their brains are still developing, Chick said, and adults of any age may also need nine or more hours when recovering from an injury, illness or sleep debt., There are also \"natural variants,\" Kolla said, referring to some people who require more than 10 hours of sleep and others who get less than four and function normally. , If you\'re wondering whether it matters if you\'re an early bird or night owl, Chick said it depends on \"whether your lifestyle is compatible\" with your preference. , RELATED: Are you a night owl or morning lark? One may protect you from depression, \"If you are a night owl, but your job requires you to be in the office at 7 am, this misalignment is less than ideal for your physical and mental health,\" she wrote in an email. \"But it would be equally problematic for a morning person who works the night shift.\", How to improve your sleep , Are you not getting enough sleep? Here are a few ways to solve that: , 1. Stick to a bedtime routine. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. You can even keep a journal to log these sleep times and how often you wake up at night, Dasgupta said, so you can have an idea of what works for you. You should also make sure your room is dark, cool and comfortable when you go to sleep. 2. Turn off the electronic devices. Do this as early as possible before bed, Chick added, as light exposure can affect your body\'s sleep-wake cycle. , , \"Particularly if you are aiming to fall asleep earlier, it\'s important to expose yourself to bright natural light as early as possible in the day, and to limit exposure to light in the hours before bedtime,\" she said. \"Electronic devices mimic many of the wavelengths in sunlight that cue your body to stay awake.\", 3. Try mindfulness techniques. Breathing exercises, meditation and yoga can also support sleep, Chick added. Her recent study showed that mindfulness training helped children sleep over an hour more per night.  4. Set good food and exercise habits. Finally, eating healthy and keeping a daily fitness regimen can support better sleep at night, Dasgupta said., \"Always try to be consistent with exercise during the day,\" he said. \"Exercise relieves stress, it helps build up your drive to sleep at night, so there\'s many good things there.\" ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/27/health/how-much-do-i-need-to-sleep-wellness/index.html',1,29),(23,'Analysis: CDC fails to publish data needed to judge risk of breakthrough infection','Federal health officials surprised just about everyone this week when they announced a change to guidance for fully vaccinated people, saying most should resume wearing masks inside.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also said everyone should wear masks in school -- students, teachers, staff and visitors., CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said new data had convinced her the Delta variant was \"behaving uniquely.\" She said the evidence indicated that fully vaccinated people who have breakthrough infections involving Delta may be as likely to transmit virus to others as unvaccinated people are., Plus, she said, people living in areas of high or sustained transmission should start wearing masks in public again -- even if they are vaccinated -- because of the higher risk of becoming infected when more virus is circulating., But she didn\'t present the data, and the CDC\'s website still indicates only 5,914 people have become severely ill with Covid or died despite having been vaccinated. , This as the CDC issued a health alert and held a rare briefing Tuesday to warn that the Delta variant was spreading more rapidly than previous variants, and urging people to mask back up and get vaccinated., Had the CDC been doing more to report breakthrough infections, the change to the masking guidance might not have taken the country so much by surprise., Instead, the seemingly sudden change in guidance looked like a flip-flop., And it calls into question President Joe Biden\'s repeated promises that his administration would not only follow the science, but would be transparent and open about it., No vaccine is 100% effective and studies are showing that while the three authorized vaccines protect well against serious disease and illness, they are less effective in preventing any type of infection, including a mild case of Covid-19 or asymptomatic infection., The CDC has tracked serious infections requiring hospitalization and deaths among fully vaccinated people. But it\'s not publishing that data in a timely manner, and it has stopped national tracking of mild and asymptomatic infections., That makes it hard to know if fully vaccinated people are, in fact, less likely to pass along the infection to others. It\'s hard to say whether people infected with the Delta variant despite having been vaccinated are more likely to infect others., And it\'s hard to be confident that the virus is not infecting millions of fully vaccinated people and perhaps evolving in their bodies under pressure from a vaccinated immune system -- a scenario that is unlikely but that could, in theory, give rise to new vaccine-impervious variants., \"I think it is important to track the symptomatic breakthrough infections. It is important to track hospitalizations and deaths -- but if you don\'t track all symptomatic ones, from the epidemiology point of view you don\'t know the frequency and severity of those symptomatic breakthrough infections,\" David Holtgrave, dean of the School of Public Health at the University at Albany, State University of New York, told CNN., \"Plus, you miss the opportunity to follow up with a sample of people with symptomatic breakthrough infections to see if they develop long haul symptoms. I don\'t think we have a good handle on that. We could use better data.\", This lack of data could also have the effect of reducing vaccine confidence, Holtgrave said., \"If you want to be able to assure the nation that breakthrough infections are rare --  and I believe symptomatic breakthrough infections are relatively rare even in the time of the Delta variant -- you have to be able to say \'we went out and looked very hard for those infections and we didn\'t find many and when we did, they weren\'t that severe,\'\" Holtgrave said., \"You are only as reassuring as the extent to which you went out and looked.\", The CDC did do this in looking for rare side-effects from the Covid-19 vaccines, including a rare blood clotting condition linked with the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and an unusual inflammatory response affecting the heart called myocarditis linked with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines., CDC promises more data, Walensky promised more data is forthcoming., \"In the coming days, you will actually see the published information on the science that motivated this change,\" she told CNN\'s New Day Wednesday., She made a similar promise Tuesday., \"We are collecting passive reporting data on people who are hospitalized and who have died, but we recognize that, epidemiologically, that is not going to give us the best information with regard to rates of breakthrough infection, because passive data collection is generally underreported,\" Walensky told reporters in a telephone briefing., \"In order to counter that, we have been collecting data through more than 20 cohorts of people. These include tens of thousands of people who we are following nationwide, and they include health care workers, essential workers, long-term care facilities, and in some of these cohorts, we\'re collecting PCR (test) data from every person in them weekly,\" Walensky added., \"So we are absolutely studying and evaluating breakthrough infections in many different sites, many different people, across the country. We are looking at those data on a weekly or bi-weekly basis and we will be reporting on those soon.\", Following people and testing them weekly, whether they show symptoms or not, is the best way to track asymptomatic infections., Having the number of mild and asymptomatic breakthrough infections would also help people better judge the risk of developing a severe infection despite having been vaccinated, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. , \"The number gets reported but not having the denominator makes it harder to put into context,\" Nuzzo told CNN. It might reassure people to know that while there are many breakthrough infections, only a very small percentage of them are severe enough to cause concern., \"There is a public fascination with people who contracted Covid despite being vaccinated and I think we need a way to answer that,\" Nuzzo added., It wouldn\'t even be necessary to count every single case, she said. A systematic sample -- like the cohorts Walensky described -- could be sufficient., Dr. Tom Frieden, a former CDC director who is now CEO of health advocacy group Resolve to Save Lives, makes a similar point., \"It is neither necessary nor wise for our public health systems to attempt to track every single breakthrough case that causes no or only mild symptoms,\" he wrote in a recent opinion piece for CNN., \"There are simply going to be too many, and there is little benefit to tracking illnesses that are no worse than a cold. Instead, it makes sense -- as is being done -- to do special studies of all breakthrough infections as part of specific population-based studies, and also to try to track every severe Covid illness after vaccination,\" he added., \"This should give us much better information about who is most at risk of serious illness from Covid after vaccination,and might lead to different dosing recommendations for some groups.\", Having more data on breakthroughs might also help epidemiologists better track changes in how the virus is spreading, Nuzzo said., \"I\'d like to see more sequencing to see chains of transmission and clusters and where people are getting sick,\" she said., Giving ammunition to vaccine resistance, Better data on breakthrough infections would also support the argument for vaccinating the entire population to provide herd immunity. , The lack of data to back up the changed guidance gave an opening to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and other Republican governors to say the changing guidance would diminish confidence in the vaccine -- and to double down on their refusal to do more to get their citizens to get vaccinated and wear masks., It also creates the impression that the new guidance was issued for political reasons., \"Do you really think that CDC has changed mask guidance for vaccinated adults, to use Dr. Walensky\'s words, because ... a vaccinated person may transmit virus to an unvaccinated person? No,\" Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University, told CNN Tuesday night.,  \"They changed guidance to do the right thing, which was to force basically unvaccinated people to be vaccinated.\", Some people who are resisting vaccination say it\'s a personal choice, affecting only themselves., Dr. Paul Offit would beg to differ., \"There\'s an old study of measles transmission between 1999 and 2000. It\'s going to sound counterintuitive, what they found but if you think about it, it makes sense,\" Offit, a vaccine adviser to the FDA and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN\'s Jim Acosta last week., \"Obviously, you were least likely to get measles if you were vaccinated living in a highly vaccinated community. But you were actually more likely to get measles if you were vaccinated living in a highly unvaccinated community than if you were unvaccinated living in a highly vaccinated community,\" Offit said., That\'s in line with what the CDC said Tuesday. The CDC might benefit from showing its sources, also.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/health/breakthrough-cases-cdc-analysis/index.html',1,30),(24,'CDC recommends encouraging everyone to wear a mask in school, regardless of vaccination status','The \"In areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the Delta variants and protect others -- this includes school,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told a media briefing on Tuesday. , \"CDC recommends that everyone in K through 12 schools wear a mask indoors, including teachers, staff, students and visitors, regardless of vaccination status. Children should return to full-time in-person learning in the fall with proper prevention strategies in place,\" she said. \"Finally, CDC recommends community leaders encourage vaccination and universal masking to prevent further outbreaks in areas of substantial and high transmission with the Delta various. Vaccinating more Americans now is more urgent than ever.\", , Previously, the CDC updated its Covid-19 guidance for schools earlier this month, noting that fully vaccinated people did not have to wear masks, and then about a week later the American Academy of Pediatrics issued stricter guidance recommending that everyone older than 2 wear a mask in schools, regardless of their vaccination status. , Now, the agency is updating its mask guidance overall, recommending that fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors when in areas with \"substantial\" and \"high\" transmission of Covid-19, which includes more than half of all US counties. , Nearly half -- 46% -- of US counties currently have high transmission and 17% have \"substantial\" transmission, according to data from the CDC, as of Tuesday morning., \"When we released our school guidance on July 9, we had less Delta variant in this country, we had fewer cases in this country, and importantly, we were really hopeful that we would have more people vaccinated, especially in the demographic between 12 to 17 years old,\" Walensky said. , \"Next week, we have many school systems that are starting around the country, and I think we all agree that children 11 or less are not going to be able to be vaccinated,\" she said. \"With only 30% of kids between 12 and 17 fully vaccinated now, more cases in this country, and a real effort to try and make sure that our kids can safely get back to full in person learning in the fall, we\'re recommending that everybody wear masks right now.\", The nation\'s three largest school districts -- New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago -- already require masks in schools. Among the top 12 districts in the country, all are requiring masks except those in Florida and Texas, where the governors have banned mask mandates in schools, prior to Tuesday\'s updated CDC guidance., For instance, in Texas, \"earlier this summer, Governor Abbott issued an executive order banning mask mandates on public school campuses so HISD cannot require them but those who want to wear mask may certainly do so,\" Dennis Spellman, spokesperson for Houston Independent School District, told CNN in an email on Tuesday., Some other schools, such as Little Rock School District in Arkansas, told CNN on Tuesday that they are reviewing the new CDC recommendations., , Before the updated CDC guidance, at least 14 of the 30 largest US school districts overall are making masks optional for students in school, while another 13 are requiring masks. As of last week, three districts were undecided. School districts have indicated they may change their guidance according to local public health conditions even after the school year starts., Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\'s Center for Health Security, told CNN in an email on Tuesday that she thinks the updated CDC guidance will be enough to encourage some schools to issue mask mandates., \"School districts look to CDC for guidance so having clear recommendations will make it easier for them to set masking policies,\" Rivers wrote in the email., \"I encourage indoor masking for children too young to be vaccinated,\" she added. \"The delta variant spreads very easily, and classrooms are high risk environments without protective measures. Children are at much lower risk of severe illness than adults, but they can and do get infected and transmit the virus to others.\", , Overall, it\'s \"reassuring\" that the CDC is updating its guidance given that the Delta variant has been shown to be more contagious, Dr. Vivek Cherian, an internal medicine physician affiliated with the University of Maryland Medical System, told CNN in an email on Tuesday. He called the updated guidance for schools \"the best and safest course of action\" to protect children at this time., \"On a personal note, we are in the process of moving to Chicago and are basing our decision on school selection based off of their approach to mask mandate because it is that critical to offer our children the greatest advantage of staying safe,\" Cherian said about his own family., \"There is no question that the updated recommendations will encourage some schools (if not most) to issue or reissue mask mandates. Many schools are implementing guidance based on the CDC recommendations in general,\" Cherian wrote. \"I would consider it reckless on the part of schools to not move forward in updating mask mandates given that the Delta variant is now the predominant strain in the country, and given that a large population of the K-12 population is still unvaccinated.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/27/health/cdc-guidance-wear-a-mask-in-school-bn/index.html',1,31),(25,'The pandemic is \'spiraling out of control\' due to unvaccinated people, Trump\'s surgeon general says','For anyone who loves freedom and hates mask mandates or remote learning, Dr. Jerome Adams has a blunt message: Get vaccinated. \"More mitigation is coming. Whether it\'s masking, or whether it\'s closures or whether it\'s your kids having to return to virtual learning, that is coming,\" the Trump administration official and WISH/TV Indianapolis Medical Expert told CBS\' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday. , \"And it\'s coming because this pandemic is spiraling out of control yet again. And it\'s spiraling out of control because we don\'t have enough people vaccinated.\", As of Sunday, only 49.1% of Americans have been fully vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. , That\'s nowhere near enough vaccinations to stop the spread of the Delta variant, the most contagious strain of novel coronavirus ever identified. , In 48 states, the rate of new Covid-19 cases this past week jumped by at least 10% compared to the previous week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. , In 34 of those states, the rate of new cases increased by more than 50%., Hospitals are filling up again with Covid-19 patients except now, patients are younger than before, said doctors in Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Missouri., \"The thing that\'s making this possible is the fact that we are dealing with the most transmissible version of Covid-19 that we\'ve seen to date,\" current US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said. , So eligible Americans who want to prevent more mask mandates, business closures and a return to remote learning need to do their part and get vaccinated, said Adams, the Trump administration official. , \"It\'s going to help every single American enjoy the freedoms that we want to return to,\" he said., , Vaccine mandates easier with FDA approval, official says, Vaccine mandates would be the quickest way to raise vaccination rates, Adams told CBS Sunday. But that won\'t happen without full approval by the US Food and Drug Administration., \"If you want to get a bunch of people vaccinated really quickly, get these vaccines licensed,\" Adams said. \"And then you\'ll see the military make it mandatory, you\'ll see businesses make it mandatory.\", Each vaccine available in the United States has been authorized by the FDA for emergency use, but they have yet to be fully approved. , And the lack of full-fledged approval is contributing to vaccine hesitancy, he said., Asked Sunday if vaccine mandates should be on the table, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeffrey Zients told CNN municipal governments  and businesses should consider any strategy that would make it safe to enter their location, whether that\'s requiring vaccines or negative Covid-19 tests. , But he wants the FDA to take its time to thoroughly review the applications for approval, so the public knows the agency wasn\'t \"bowing to political pressure.\" , Dr. Doran Fink of the FDA\'s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said last week the agency was \"working as rapidly as possible\" to review submissions for approval. , Zients is hopeful some approval will come sometime in August or September. President Biden last week said full approval could come before the end of August. , Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have started their applications for full FDA approval, while Johnson &amp; Johnson has said it intends to file for licensure., Immunocompromised people might be the first to get an extra dose , The Covid-19 vaccines used in the US don\'t have any coronavirus in them, but they do require an immune system response to work., So millions of Americans who are immunocompromised or take drugs that suppress the immune system might not get as much help from a vaccine as others do., While there\'s been much speculation as to whether (or when) booster shots might be needed, the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration said this month that \"Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time.\", But that could change as the data evolves, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  , If a booster dose of vaccine is needed, people with suppressed immune systems might be the first to get one, Fauci told CNN on Sunday., Those with suppressed immune systems can include transplant patients, those undergoing cancer chemotherapy, people with autoimmune diseases and those who are taking immune-suppressing drugs, Fauci said. , Like with many other vaccines, a small fraction of vaccinated people have gotten breakthrough infections. , But more than 97% of those hospitalized with Covid-19 are unvaccinated, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said last week. , Within the tiny percentage of US hospitalized Covid-19 patients who were fully vaccinated, a study found 44% of them were immunocompromised people., The CDC and the FDA are \"exploring multiple options\" for how to make a third dose of Covid-19 vaccine possible for immunocompromised people if needed, according to a statement Friday., \"Emerging data show there is an enhanced antibody response after an additional dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in some immunocompromised people,\" the CDC said in a statement to CNN on Friday. , \"While early data show some potential benefit to administering an additional dose, more evidence is needed to determine safety and effectiveness in immunocompromised people.\", Those who are immunocompromised and vaccinated against Covid-19 might still want to keep wearing masks, Murthy said. , Surging Covid-19 numbers, In California, San Diego County and Los Angeles County both reported their highest number of cases since February, and hospitalizations in LA County have more than doubled in two weeks. On Sunday, Los Angeles County officials said hospitalizations surpassed 700 for the first time since March., In Florida, state health data shows that new case positivity nearly doubled in two weeks, from 7.8% the week of July 2 to 15.1%., A total of 870 hospitalized patients were reported Sunday in Alabama, according to the state\'s public health Covid-19 dashboard. Hospitalizations there have been steadily rising since early July: On July 4 there were just 213 hospitalized patients reported., And Louisiana now has the highest increase in cases per capita in the US, state officials said Friday., \"We know that more than 80% of these are the Delta variant -- that is what\'s causing this surge,\" Gov. John Bel Edwards said. , \"And what\'s enabling the surge is a very low percentage of people who have been vaccinated.\", In the rare case that a fully vaccinated person later gets infected, that infection will likely result in mild or no symptoms at all, Murthy said., \"If you do get a breakthrough infection -- which itself will be unusual -- it will be more likely to be mild or asymptomatic,\" the surgeon general said., The bottom line? \"If you get the vaccine and still get a breakthrough infection, you are protected close to 100% from being hospitalized, getting severely sick and dying,\" said Dr. Saju Mathew, a primary care physician and public health specialist. , \"What more do you really want from a vaccine?\" , This story has been updated with additional information about Dr. Adams','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/25/health/us-coronavirus-sunday/index.html',1,32),(26,'Some people are seeking out a second dose of Covid-19 vaccine after getting J&amp;J shot','Jason Gallagher, an infectious disease pharmacist in Philadelphia had gotten the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine through a clinical trial in November, but this summer he didn\'t like the direction Covid-19 cases were taking due to variants.\"Come June, I started to get nervous about this Delta variant spreading and had some travel plans,\" said Gallagher, a clinical professor at Temple University School of Pharmacy., So, Gallagher decided to get a dose of a different mRNA vaccine, even though he was already considered fully protected with his single dose of the J&amp;J vaccine. , Once word got around that he got an extra dose, he started hearing from many others who had done the same. , \"My phone was kind of ringing off the hook for a week,\" Gallagher said. , , Right now, trying to boost your immune system with an additional dose of Covid-19 vaccine after a J&amp;J shot is not recommended. The vaccine makers are studying whether that needs to change. , , , Gallagher is not the only scientist who is getting ahead of the guidance. , Angela Rasmussen, a virologist who works with Georgetown University tweeted in June that she got an mRNA vaccine after having had the J&amp;J shot, so that she would be \"as protected as possible from the Delta variant.\" , In June, Dr. Vin Gupta, a professor at the University of Washington\'s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation also tweeted the advice he said he\'s given patients: \"If you received the 1-dose J&amp;J, go and get 1-shot of Pfizer or Moderna as a \"booster\" when you\'re able. Most I know who got J&amp;J are doing it and are telling others the same — since two seems better than 1 re: delta.\" , , More than 13.2 million people in the US have gotten the J&amp;J single dose vaccine, according to the CDC. The vaccine is effective and protects well against hospitalization and death, studies show. , In a statement, Johnson and Johnson said, \"We believe that the single-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine will continue to offer durable protection, and at present there is no evidence to suggest a need for a booster dose to be administered.\", Health experts CNN spoke to said people\'s interest in another dose seemed to pick up as the Delta variant started spreading and after research from New York University found some evidence that people who got the J&amp;J vaccine might benefit from an additional dose. , That study is a preprint, meaning it was not subject to careful peer review. It was done on blood from vaccinated volunteers, so it did not reflect real world conditions, but it showed that at least some of the newly emerging variants, including the Delta variant, may evade the protection offered by a single dose of the vaccine. , That study contradicted an earlier finding from J&amp;J published in the New England Journal of Medicine that showed a single dose of its vaccine protected well against the Delta variant, with protection lasting at least eight months., , That protection, Dr. John Zaia, the director of the Center for Gene Therapy at City of Hope in California said, is demonstrated by the current data on hospitalizations. He does not recommend an additional dose., \"We have not yet seen anyone saying that hospitalized people in the United States are those that got the J&amp;J vaccine. I think that tells us a lot,\" Zaia said., Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security does not recommend an additional dose either. He said the data doesn\'t support the need for it. , \"There\'s a lot of people who like to beat up on the J&amp;J vaccine; however, when you look at what we want in a vaccine, we want it to prevent serious disease, hospitalization and death, and I see no indication that the J&amp;J vaccine is failing at the primary tasks that it\'s designed to do,\" Adalja said. , , Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center in Philadelphia agrees and said J&amp;J is still an \"excellent\" vaccine. , \"I don\'t know of any data that suggests the need for a booster dose,\" Offit said. \"I understand that has become a thing, but the vaccines still induce excellent protection against critical disease caused by the Delta variant.\" , Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University is not making a recommendation, but he\'s seen a growing interest., \"People are talking about it more overtly, not only just among themselves,\" Schaffner said. \"There\'s an awful lot of folks out there, and I think it\'s a substantial number, the more I hear about this, who are working the system.\", , People vaccinated with the J&amp;J vaccine must work the system because it is against the official guidance for a pharmacy or a vaccine clinic to give an additional dose. That could change once a vaccine is authorized by the FDA. Then a doctor could prescribe it off-label. But for now people are finding ways around the guidance., Schaffner said he\'s heard some people have gone out of state to get an extra dose, since there is no national vaccine registry. He\'s also heard that others have found pharmacies and vaccine sites that don\'t ask a lot of questions., \"They\'re just happy for you to come in and get a vaccine,\" Schaffner said., , Schaffner said there is no real data to show that an additional dose would be harmful, so if patients are asking about an additional dose, it may be possible that doctors are figuring that into their calculations in counseling patients., \"The question not only in the patient\'s mind, but in the doctors mind is, \'well, if it\'s not going to hurt? What harm could it do?\'\" Schaffner said. The doctor may also be thinking, \"I can\'t tell you how much benefits you\'re going to get, but maybe it\'ll make us both feel better.\'\" ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/26/health/covid-19-vaccine-should-you-get-additional-dose/index.html',1,33),(27,'5 ways to get your kids to wear masks','Add it to your fall 2021 back to school shopping list: Buy more masks. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to recommend that everyone in K-12 schools wear a mask, regardless of their vaccination status, as it updates its masking guidelines in response to the more transmissible Delta variant, according to an administration health official., We know that little humans pull and tug at the masks constantly, and kids don\'t just stop there. They let the tops fall beneath their noses and sometimes even yank the things down below their mouths, just because they can., Despite all these protests from children in countries where face coverings aren\'t already part of the culture, masks are a must this fall, according to the CDC., The CDC has already recommended that all kids over the age of 2 wear face coverings in indoor public places to help reduce the spread of Covid-19. , That means that now is the time to get kids back on board with the reality of masks in schools. We know kids around the world who already know how to wear masks — it\'s simply part of their routine when they leave the house. , How do you get your child there? We\'ve asked doctors, psychologists and parents for their best strategies for getting little ones to wear face coverings and keep them on. Here are their top five suggestions., Know your child, , , Every child is different, which means it behooves parents to take the time to think about how each of their children may relate to face coverings., \"It\'s not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing,\" said Jennifer Sciolla, senior director of child and family services at Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Delaware. \"You always want to make that time and space in the beginning for parents to consider their child.\", Parents should ask themselves a series of questions before even trying to formulate a strategy to get kids to wear face coverings, Sciolla suggested. , Among them: What is important to my child? How does my child understand information? How aware of the outside world is my child? To what extent might a mask or the possibility of a mask give my child anxiety?, Part of the issue is age. Toddlers may be frightened to see others in masks because they lack the ability to recognize and read faces that kids develop by adolescence, research has indicated., , , Another factor: a child\'s developmental needs., Stephanie Ranno, whose 7-year-old daughter Emmy is on the autism spectrum, said her daughter struggles to wear face coverings for any extended period. Ranno, who lives outside of Baltimore, added that it\'s hard to know why her daughter dislikes the masks because she has expressive language delay, which means she can\'t always communicate adequately., \"Emmy is learning to interpret facial expressions for appropriate social interactions and masks make it nearly impossible for that to happen,\" Ranno wrote via text message. \"Our main concerns in sending her back to school center on difficulty in her ability to safely and positively interact with teachers and classmates.\", , Explain what\'s up, , Parents and guardians can\'t simply expect little ones to understand why they should wear face coverings — parents must explain it with words and concepts the kids can understand., For preschool-age children, this might mean offering a Sesame Street version of pandemic etiquette: The virus is a bad guy, and we humans must do what we can to protect our lungs and bodies from it. For others, especially older kids, it might mean a more detailed and sophisticated rundown of public health and our individual responsibility to a greater good., Parents can emphasize kindness to get kids to understand that wearing face coverings isn\'t only about them, recommended Liza Suarez, assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago., \"It\'s helpful to say things like, \'Face coverings reduce the chances we infect others,\' and, \'If we all wear masks, we protect each other,\'\" said Suarez, director of the university\'s Pediatric Stress and Anxiety Disorders Clinic. \"You can\'t really go wrong if you teach your child that we\'re all part of this world, and we need to help each other out.\", Maki Katsuki, a mother of three, agreed. Katsuki moved to Sonoma County, California, from Niseko, Japan, in 2017, and she remembers what she learned about face coverings as a child growing up in Asia., \"Everyone was taught wearing a mask when you are sick is key because you don\'t want to spread germs to other people,\" she said., Katsuki added that she repeatedly has required her children to wear face coverings over the years, saying, \"We also wear masks to prevent (from getting) sick when others are sick.\", Engage and involve your children, , Another way to get kids excited about face coverings is to make them part of the process. This can be as simple as letting kids select their own masks or as complicated as inviting kids to sit down at the sewing machine., For Melissa Cousino, the wonder was in letting her 3-year-old pick out a face covering. The girl loves purple and jumped at the chance to choose a mask that was her favorite color. In general, kids also appreciate getting to have a say in style of the masks they wear, Cousino added., \"You\'d let them pick out a T-shirt,\" said Cousino, assistant professor of pediatrics at Michigan Medicine, the academic medical center of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \"Why wouldn\'t you let them pick out a face covering?\", , , Courtney Fitzgerald, who lives in Shawnee, Kansas, has taken the commitment to engagement one step further, getting her three children to help make masks., Fitzgerald said she has made about two dozen masks since the pandemic began — including some with rainbow tie-dye, floral-patterned fabric, one with the Kansas City Chiefs logo and a throwback print with dinosaurs and trolls., Specifically, she said the kids have helped cut out the fabric and make the folds in the masks themselves., \"It reminds me of the advice from the professionals on how to get your kids to eat new foods — you involve them in the process,\" said Fitzgerald, who admitted to raiding her mother\'s fabric stash for some of the harder-to-find patterns. \"I (often) find them digging through the fabric pile and picking out the next one they want me to make.\", Practice, practice, practice, Once parents have sold kids on the idea of wearing face coverings, it\'s critical for parents to get them to embrace it. At the very minimum, this means getting children to wear the masks — and getting them to wear the masks the right way., Parents can try having kids wear their masks in the house for short increments to feel more comfortable, Suarez, the psychiatrist, said. Cousino added that another fun activity is to have kids don masks and look at themselves in the mirror to get familiar with the different permutations of \"smizing,\" or smiling with your eyes. (She called this \"medical play.\"), Parents could also consider turning mask-wearing into a game, suggested Gail Robertson, a child psychologist at Children\'s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. , \"Because we have this association in our culture with (public health) being scary — having (face coverings) as a part of play is essential,\" said Robertson, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine. , , , \"Make it for a doll. I also love having masks in the playroom and their bedroom so (kids) can play with them and investigate them. We want to make masks a part of their normal environment.\", Dr. Mary Mason, an internist based in St. Louis, believes in this approach, too., In 1999, Mason founded Little Medical School, a science and technology course provider. , Earlier last year, her company rolled out Face Covering Kits that comprise two cloth face coverings, a 6-foot tape measure, and a sheet of stickers that read BACK UP 6 FEET, I\'M SOCIAL DISTANCING, MY GOOD HABIT IS WASHING MY HANDS and more., \"We don\'t want kids to think they need a real surgeon\'s mask, but we do want to make sure they understand the science,\" Mason said. \"When you give kids facts and the science behind them, you empower them to seek the truth.\", Communicate repeatedly, Especially with younger kids, repetition is a key to ensuring compliance with new rules. This means that as much as you don\'t want to nag, you may have to sound like a broken record in order for your children to take face coverings seriously and understand the gravity of the situation in the midst of a global pandemic., The name of the game is consistency, Suarez said, noting that parents must relentlessly remind children of this rule: They simply cannot move around in the world right now without wearing a mask to protect themselves and others., \"It\'s like anything with parenting, really; this isn\'t going to happen overnight,\" she said. \"Instead, parents need to accept that they\'re laying a foundation that requires gradual increments of time. Little by little, parents get the message across.\", , , Lenneia Elmore, who lives in Orlando, Florida, understands this challenge fundamentally., Elmore recently joked that she has been so on-message lately, she practically has developed a mask-oriented mantra for her 2.5-year-old daughter, Ava., \"Whenever we go anywhere, I keep telling her, \'Don\'t take off your mask, only play with Mommy,\'\" said Elmore, whose family has a history of medical conditions. \"I started saying it to her back in April (2020), and now she repeats it back to me. She used to think I was \'mean\' when I asked her to wear one. Now she gets it. She wears it without giving me an attitude. It\'s like it finally sunk in. Thank goodness.\", This story has been updated from a story originally published in July 2020.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/27/health/get-kids-to-wear-face-masks-2021-wellness/index.html',1,34),(28,'In these 2 states, every county is listed as \'high transmission\' for Covid-19','Florida and Arkansas currently share a grim distinction when it comes to the spread of the coronavirus. Every one of the two states\' counties is now listed as having \"high\" levels of community transmission, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., The CDC lists high transmission in nearly every county in several other states, including Missouri, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. , The CDC considers a county to have high transmission if there have been 100 or more cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 residents or a test positivity rate of 10% or higher in the past seven days., Nearly 44% of US counties fall into this category, according to the latest CDC county-level update. , New cases triple over two weeks in Florida, Over the past week, Florida accounted for nearly a quarter of all cases in the United States -- more than any other state., Florida, with 67 counties, reported an average of 10,452 new cases each day over the past week -- more than triple the daily average from two weeks ago, according to data from Johns Hopkins University., The case rate in Florida over the past week -- about 49 new cases per 100,000 people each day -- is more than three times the US rate of about 16 new cases per 100,000 people each day. Only Arkansas and Louisiana had higher case rates over the past week., Florida hospitals are grappling with a surge of Covid-19 patients., \"We could be an entire hospital full of Covid in a matter of a month if things don\'t begin to slow down or vaccinations don\'t increase,\" Chad Neilsen, the director of infection prevention at the University of Florida Health Jacksonville, told CNN last week. Neilsen added that 90% of Covid patients at the hospital are not vaccinated. , Florida also reported more Covid-19 deaths than any other state over the past week -- a total of 282 over the past week -- the sixth highest per capita rate of deaths in the country., The state has fully vaccinated 48.5% of its residents, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- below the US rate of 49.1%., Low vaccination rate in Arkansas, Arkansas, with 75 counties, reported 11,748 new cases and 56 new deaths this past week with a positivity rating of 19.3% according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. , About 36% of Arkansas residents are fully vaccinated, the site reported., The GOP governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson, says Covid infections are soaring because of the low vaccination rate, \"This is a pivotal moment in our race against the Covid virus. We have school coming up. We have a lot of sports activities that people are expecting and anxious about,\" Hutchinson told CNN\'s Jake Tapper Sunday on \"State of the Union.\" , \"And what\'s holding us back is a low vaccination rate,\" said Hutchinson., But, the governor said, a push to get people vaccinated is working, with a 40% increase in vaccinations since he\'s been holding Town Hall meetings promoting vaccination. ,  \"We\'re seeing people that were previously resistant or hesitant about it coming in and getting the vaccination,\" he said., LA County tops 3,000 new daily cases, , The most populous county in the US is also recording a high transmission rate., Los Angeles County -- with a population of about 10 million -- reported 3,058 new Covid-19 cases Friday, the third day in a row that the county reported more than 2,500 cases, county health officials said in a news release., \"As transmission accelerates in L.A. County, Public Health cautions that unvaccinated people are becoming infected at 2.7 times the rate of transmission of just one month ago,\" the department said in the release., More than 10,000 cases were reported over the last four days, health officials said, warning about the accelerating transmission in the county., Hospitalizations are also increasing countywide, the department said.

But few groups in the United States have had it as bad as older folks.   Very early on, it became apparent that the older you were, the worse you would likely fare against the coronavirus, a fact that has held true throughout the pandemic. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, roughly 95% of all Covid deaths in the country have been in those age 50 and above, with a full 80% of them in people age 65 and older -- even though they make up 16.5% of the US population., So, to protect our older family and friends, the public health message from the start was clear: Stay away from others, lock down tighter. Even if, at times, that seemed inhumane. Who can forget all the photos and stories from nursing homes, with forlorn residents on one side of the glass doors, and their anxious families on the other? Nursing homes were particularly hard-hit in the spring and summer of 2020; according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, more than 1 in 5 Covid-19 deaths in the US thus far has been a nursing home resident. But, even those who live on their own and were freely able to come and go, the so-called community-dwelling older adults, often kept to themselves. , For many, those months and months of social isolation -- sequestered from family, friends, hobbies, jobs, volunteer opportunities and all the other things that shape a life and give it meaning -- had detrimental effects.   , I was worried about my own parents. They\'re lucky because they had each other, but neither my family nor my brother\'s had seen them for months. Everyone was missing one other. Sure, we all Zoomed and Facetimed regularly, but I don\'t have to tell you it\'s just not the same.  , The high cost of loneliness , Humans are social creatures, not meant to live without connection to others. Many studies have found that social isolation and loneliness are not good for the brain, body or spirit. In older adults, they\'re linked to symptoms such as pain, insomnia, depression, anxiety and even a shorter life expectancy. They\'re also associated with cognitive decline and a higher risk for Alzheimer\'s disease. And younger people are not immune either: loneliness and social isolation are linked to disrupted sleep patterns, altered immune systems, higher levels of both inflammation and stress hormones -- all of which can lead to problems down the road if they become chronic issues. , The consequences of loneliness aren\'t relegated to the future, either. One study, published recently as a research letter in JAMA, found that adults older than 65 are more likely to use medications meant to treat physical and psychological symptoms -- like antidepressants, sleep medications, benzodiazepines, anti-inflammatories, even opioids -- the higher they score on a loneliness survey. The study authors note that these medications are not benign in the elderly: They\'re high-risk and associated with bad outcomes including gastrointestinal bleeds, falls, fractures, delirium or cognitive impairment, new functional disability and even death. , Dr. Preeti Malani, a professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at the University of Michigan, is the director of the National Poll on Healthy Aging. She told me recently there is no doubt the pandemic increased feelings of loneliness among the elderly. , \"We actually did a few specific polls during the pandemic on loneliness and social isolation, and we had polled on this back in 2018. And at that point numbers were like 34% felt a lack of companionship, 27% felt isolated from others,\" she said. During the pandemic, those levels jumped to 41% and 56%.  , In fact, the survey found feelings of isolation in adults between the ages of 50 and 80 jumped from 27% in October 2018 to 56% in March-June 2020. And just over a quarter (28%) those respondents reported having social contact with people outside the home once a week or less in 2018, compared to almost half (46%) in 2020.  , Vaccines bring hope, but fear lingers , I think it is fair to say the road to once again enjoying each other\'s company has been paved by the advent of Covid vaccines. Once they came into play, many people felt comfortable enough to plan their family reunion. I count my family in this camp -- we waited a relatively long time, until the beginning of July, because my wife and I wanted our teen and tween daughters to be fully vaccinated before meeting up with my parents. Once that happened, we -- and they -- were comfortable enough to plan our trip.  , But not everyone has been comfortable venturing out far and wide -- especially not the elderly, maybe because they are so aware of how vulnerable they are.  , Geriatrician Dr. Anita Major, an assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, is part of Harris Health System\'s House Call Service, which offers house calls to the homebound, many of them elderly.  , She said a return to a semblance of normal has been a real struggle for some of her patients. , \"I go into homes now and people have what they [themselves] have termed \'re-entrance anxiety,\' where they\'re so fearful, thinking, \'Why didn\'t I always wear a mask in the grocery store; I should have.\' Some of the things that we have implemented now to protect from Covid, they\'re like, \'I should have always been doing that. Maybe I just should never have gone out. I don\'t need to go out -- because now everything can be brought to you or delivered,\' \" she said.  , Fear notwithstanding, Major said that if there\'s a choice, remaining isolated is not necessarily the best option.  , \"Part of aging gracefully is being robust in all facets of your life: emotional, spiritual, psychological, medical, functional -- and the social aspect is huge,\" she said.   , Back in the social saddle , So how can we help our older family and friends ease out of a fear-based pandemic mindset? There is no one-size-fits-all formula, said Major. , \"I think we need to ask our elders what matters to them. Sometimes people acknowledge, \'I\'m lonely,\' while some people can be alone without being lonely,\" she said. \"And it may be that they don\'t appreciate the value of the social interaction until it\'s happened. But, I think, a safe space to start is [asking] \'What matters to you?\' \' What\'s the space that would make that [activity] feel fine and safe?\'\" she said. , Major notes that a \"huge tenet\" of geriatric medicine in general is asking: \"What matters to you and how can I help you?\" Caregivers, doctors and family members may have their own thoughts and ideas about what should be done, but will the older person engage with or derive benefit from it? , She said families can start with baby steps -- a picnic outdoors with vaccinated friends and family, for example. \"I think you have to meet people where they are, and obviously not force it ... [and] not shaming people for being fearful or worried,\" she said. , Malani agrees \"meeting them where they are\" is really important, as is trying to understand what they\'re concerned about. She said when people say, \"This is too fast, I\'m not ready,\" ask what they need to help them feel ready.  , But there\'s a flip side. \"My feeling is, if anything, that the pandemic has also taught us that we might not get that second chance to do some of these things, and that being present is also part of being well,\" she said.  , No riding off into the sunset , My family reunion, I have to say, went really well. It was just wonderful to just spend time with my parents and my brother\'s family, too. As proof of the benefits of human connection, I could feel my stress melting away, my blood pressure and my heart rate dropping a bit, being around so much laughter and unconditional love. And the old adage, absence makes the heart grow fonder, certainly held true. , But it\'s also true that my parents seemed a bit older, a bit more hesitant in their steps and the creases around their eyes appeared a little deeper to me. And they really were more reluctant to venture out without their masks.  , But in their case, I don\'t think it\'s a fear-based holdover from the lockdown era, it\'s more like a logical step: They\'re both data-driven scientists and are concerned about the incredible rise in infections in this country due to the Delta variant. The mask is an extra layer of protection on top of being vaccinated. , Once again, it\'s especially important for people over 65; according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, even though a greater proportion of this group is fully vaccinated -- more than 79% -- they make up 74% of breakthrough cases requiring hospitalization or resulting in death. , In my family, we like to use a weather-related analogy: You look at the app and it tells you it\'s going to rain. Being vaccinated is like wearing a good rain jacket to protect yourself. But if it\'s pouring outside -- if you\'re just getting bombarded with a lot of virus because transmission is high -- then you probably still want an umbrella: in this case, a mask. , Never underestimate the wisdom of our elders.

Results from an additional 12 studies was added to the analysis to make a combined sample of over 48,000 people. , The new study found the lowest risk occurred when people with existing heart conditions drank from 6 to 8 grams of alcohol per day (42 to 56 grams a week). People who drank 8 grams of alcohol a day had a 27% lower risk of a second cardiovascular event compared with people with heart disease that did not drink. , But when people drank a bit less -- only 6 grams of alcohol a day -- the benefit almost doubled. They had a 50% lower risk of having another heart attack, stroke or episode of angina than those who did not drink. , That\'s not a lot of booze at one sitting. In the United States, that would be about a half a glass of regular beer or wine or 0.75 ounces of distilled spirits. , In the UK, where a standard unit of alcohol is 10 milliliters or 8 grams, it\'s a bit more complicated. For example, \"a pint of strong lager contains 3 units of alcohol,\" according to the UK\'s National Health Services. So 6 grams of alcohol would only be a third of a pint of strong lager a day., No amount of alcohol, For decades, a \"drink a day\" was considered fine by public health standards because many similar studies over the years found a positive association between moderate drinking and a reduced risk of heart disease, the world\'s leading killer. In fact, most health organizations still allow one to two drinks a day for men and one or fewer drinks a day for women as part of their dietary guidelines. , Other studies also found a connection between moderate drinking and a reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes, a growing epidemic globally., But all along, there were practical problems. After all, many people pour heavy and end up adding much more than a \"standard\" or \"unit\" of alcohol to their mixed drink. The arrival of \"gravity\" beers and wines with much higher than normal levels of alcohol also compounded the issue. Just how much alcohol were people really drinking in that \"one to two\" drinks?, Another issue: Just how truthful are people when they tell study researchers how much they drink? , \"A 60-year-old male in Greece and 75-year-old woman in Germany -- who knows what they have in mind when they\'re answering that question,\" the IHME\'s Gakidou said. \"The probability that someone is going to answer truthfully and factually is likely zero.\", Research began to show a connection between drinking and the development of dementia, liver disease, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, digestive disorders and cancer, another leading killer.  , Add to that the global toll drinking has on the loss of life from accidents and injuries, and the message for the masses was that no amount of alcohol was beneficial for health., \'While some studies have found improved health outcomes among moderate drinkers, it\'s impossible to conclude whether these improved outcomes are due to moderate alcohol consumption or other differences in behaviors or genetics between people who drink moderately and people who don\'t,\" according to the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention., Gakidou, who authored a 2016 study that concluded no amount of alcohol was safe, told CNN that research since she published her study is beginning to hone in on more specifics about how alcohol contributes to illness. Soon, she says, we may even know how alcohol raises -- or lowers -- the risk of individual diseases by age, gender and country or region that people live in., \"We may be able to say \'If you are a 30-year-old male living in Sub-Saharan Africa or in Europe or Southeast Asia, here is your safest level of drinking.\' And then if you\'re a 60-year-old female living in these regions, what is your safest level of drinking,\" Gakidou said., If you don\'t drink, don\'t start, Until science discovers exactly how alcohol interacts with all the various diseases and conditions that affect us, there\'s one thing public health organizations agree on: If you don\'t drink, don\'t start -- even if you have a heart condition., The CDC states current guidelines \"do not recommend that individuals who do not drink alcohol start drinking for any reason.\" The agency says those who should avoid alcohol completely include: , Women who are pregnant or might be pregnant.Anyone under the legal age for drinking.Anyone planning to drive or do activities that require coordination and alertness.People with certain medical conditions, such as liver disease.Taking over-the-counter or prescription medications that can interact with alcohol, such as painkillers, sleeping pills, ADHD meds, antibiotics and some blood pressure drugs.People who are recovering from an alcohol use disorder or who are unable to control the amount they drink., And if adults of \"legal drinking age choose to drink alcoholic beverages, drinking less is better for health than drinking more,\" the CDC states.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/26/health/alcohol-heart-benefit-wellness/index.html',1,37),(31,'If you are not vaccinated against Covid-19, you shouldn\'t go into a bar or restaurant, expert says ','Less than half of the US population is fully vaccinated against \"What I would say bluntly is: If you are not vaccinated right now in the United States, you should not go into a bar, you should probably not eat at a restaurant. You are at great risk of becoming infected,\" CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner, professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University, told CNN\'s Fredricka Whitfield., In 48 states, the rate of new Covid-19 cases in the past week jumped by at least 10% compared to the previous week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In 34 of those states, the rate of new cases increased by more than 50%., And with the highly transmissible Delta variant now the dominant strain, the US could see 200,000 new Covid-19 cases a day within the next six weeks, Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Monday., The last time there were more then 200,000 new US cases in one day was in January, according to Johns Hopkins University data. , And hospitals are filling up with Covid-19 patients again, except now, patients are younger than before, said doctors in Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Missouri., Despite the encouragement of many officials and experts\' warnings that the best protection from the virus comes from vaccinations, only 49.1% of the US population is vaccinated, according to data from the CDC. , If a large swath of people remains resistant to vaccination, Reiner said, the US is left with two options to control the spread: shut down businesses -- which few people want to do -- or return to masks., \"The only way to get the unvaccinated to mask up is to mask everyone up,\" Reiner said. , While masking, like vaccination, could come from mandates by state leaders, Vanderbilt University Medical Center professor of infectious diseases Dr. William Schaffner said he anticipates more success if the push to return to precautions comes from local officials and trusted community leaders., And for those who say vaccination is a personal choice, Schaffner said, they are half right., \"This is a little like driving on the red light. Yes, that\'s your decision, puts you in danger, but endangers others also,\" Schaffner said., , Delta variant increases calls for precautions, Part of the urgency to control spread and implement precautions is due to the prevalence of the Delta variant, which is believed to be more transmissible than other strains of the virus. , \"At the beginning of the pandemic, the CDC said that a close contact was somebody that you\'re indoors with, unmasked for 15 minutes or more,\" Dr. Celine Gounder, who served on President Joe Biden\'s transition Covid-19 advisory board, said in an interview with STAT published Friday. \"The equivalent of that with the Delta variant is not 15 minutes, it\'s one second.\", That means people might need to do more than one thing to protect themselves from the more transmissible variant, said Gounder, an infectious diseases specialist at NYU\'s Grossman School of Medicine., In addition to vaccination, \"Some of the other layers that we should consider would be masking indoors when you\'re outside of your household bubble, optimizing ventilation in the home -- just opening your window works really well,\" she said., People should think in terms of how much virus there is in the air, plus how long they might be in contact with that virus-laden air. , \"So if you\'re indoors, there\'s not a lot of air dilution unless you\'re opening up windows and doing that sort of thing. When you\'re outdoors, it\'s almost infinitely diluted. And so outdoors, your risk is really low,\" Gounder said., As the Delta variant spreads, rates of infections and hospitalizations are on the rise., In California, San Diego and Los Angeles counties both reported their highest number of cases since February, and hospitalizations in LA County have more than doubled in two weeks. On Sunday, officials there said hospitalizations surpassed 700 for the first time since March., Florida reported an average of 10,452 new cases each day over the past week -- more than triple the daily average from two weeks ago, according to data from Johns Hopkins University., Over the past week, Florida accounted for nearly a quarter of all cases in the United States -- more than any other state., The case rate in Florida over the past week -- about 49 new cases per 100,000 people each day -- is more than three times the US rate of about 16 new cases per 100,000 people each day. Only Arkansas and Louisiana had higher case rates over the past week., Orange County, Florida, is now seeing 1,000 new cases a day in the region, the same amount as in the highest peak last year, according to Mayor Jerry Demings. , \"We are now in crisis mode,\" Demings said at a news conference Monday. , A total of 870 hospitalized patients were reported Sunday in Alabama, according to the state\'s public health Covid-19 dashboard. Hospitalizations there have been steadily rising since early July; on July 4, there were just 213 hospitalized patients reported., And Louisiana now has the highest increase in cases per capita in the US, state officials said Friday., \"We know that more than 80% of these are the Delta variant -- that is what\'s causing this surge,\" Gov. John Bel Edwards said., , Vaccines or weekly testing mandated for NYC and California employees  , Vaccination rates would likely go up, Reiner and Schaffner said, if employers and schools required vaccines. , Former US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said the same, but added that it likely won\'t happen until the vaccines gain full approval by the US Food and Drug Administration., \"If you want to get a bunch of people vaccinated really quickly, get these vaccines licensed,\" Adams told CBS Sunday. \"And then you\'ll see the military make it mandatory. You\'ll see businesses make it mandatory.\", Asked Sunday whether vaccine mandates should be on the table, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeffrey Zients told CNN that municipal governments and businesses should consider any strategy that would make it safe to enter their facilities, whether that\'s requiring vaccines or negative Covid-19 tests., Those mandates are starting to happen. California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday that all state employees and health care workers will be required to provide proof of vaccination status or get regular testing., \"As the state\'s largest employer, we are leading by example and requiring all state and health care workers to show proof of vaccination or be tested regularly, and we are encouraging local governments and businesses to do the same,\" Newsom said. \"Vaccines are safe -- they protect our family, those who truly can\'t get vaccinated, our children and our economy. Vaccines are the way we end this pandemic.\", And New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the entire city workforce will be required to get vaccinated or be tested for Covid-19 once a week by September 13. Unvaccinated employees will be required to wear face masks indoors on the job. The city has about 340,000 employees., Two cities reinstated face mask mandates on Monday to deal with rising infections., In St. Louis, Mayor Tishaura Jones said anyone 5 years of age or older will be required to wear masks in indoor public spaces and on public transportation., Jones said during a news conference that the city is still at a \"dangerous point\" with the virus and facing new case counts not seen since December. , Savannah, Georgia, Mayor Van Johnson said everyone regardless of vaccination status is required to wear facial coverings inside all city government facilities, as well as Savannah city schools and early childhood centers. The mandate does not apply to private businesses or institutions., More than 50 health care groups -- including the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics  -- issued a joint statement calling for all health care and long-term care employers to mandate employees be vaccinated against Covid-19., \"This is the logical fulfillment of the ethical commitment of all health care workers to put patients as well as residents of long-term care facilities first and take all steps necessary to ensure their health and well-being,\" they wrote in the joint statement.

Overall, vaccinated people still play a small role in transmission and breakthrough infections are rare. , In addition, the source noted two other factors that led to this decision: the prevalence of the Delta variant and low vaccine uptake. , When the CDC previously revised its guidance on May 13 for vaccinated people to unmask, Delta only represented 1% of reported infections. Now, according to the CDC, it represents at least 83% of cases. , The source also noted that the country\'s overall level of vaccination is lower than what was initially expected and that most transmission is happening in areas with vaccination levels below 40% of the population. , \"When you get information about risks and how to mitigate risks, there\'s a public health obligation to let people know about it,\" a senior administration official said. The White House is hoping that the new guidance will give local officials \"a lot of cover\" to implement new mask mandates where appropriate., Meanwhile, the guidance for unvaccinated people remains the same: continue masking until they are fully vaccinated., , Nearly half -- 46% -- of US counties currently have high transmission and 17% have \"substantial\" transmission, according to data from the CDC, as of Tuesday morning., In two states, Arkansas and Louisiana, every county is currently listed as having \"high\" levels of community transmission of Covid-19, according to CDC data. Several other states -- including Missouri, Mississippi and Alabama -- also have \"high\" transmission in nearly every county. In Florida, every county was listed with high transmission on Monday; as of Tuesday morning, one -- Glades County -- has substantial transmission., \"Vaccinated individuals continue to represent a very small amount of transmission occurring around the country. We continue to estimate that the risk of a breakthrough infection with symptom upon exposure to the Delta variant is reduced by seven-fold. The reduction of 20-fold for hospitalizations, and deaths,\" Walensky said during Tuesday\'s briefing. , \"As CDC has recommended for months, unvaccinated individuals should get vaccinated and continue masking until they are fully vaccinated,\" she said. \"In areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public, indoor settings, to help prevent the spread of the Delta variant and protect others -- this includes schools.\" , , The CDC\'s latest guidance also recommends for community leaders to encourage vaccination and mask-wearing to prevent further outbreaks in areas of substantial and high transmission. The guidance notes, \"Wearing a mask is most important if you have a weakened immune system or if, because of your age or an underlying medical condition, you are at increased risk for severe disease, or if someone in your household has a weakened immune system, is at increased risk for severe disease, or is unvaccinated. If this applies to you or your household, you might choose to wear a mask regardless of the level of transmission in your area.\", The agency recommends that local jurisdictions encourage universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students, and visitors to schools, regardless of vaccination status. , Earlier this month, the CDC\'s Covid-19 school guidance noted that fully vaccinated people do not need to wear masks, and then about a week later the American Academy of Pediatrics issued stricter guidance recommending that everyone older than 2 wear a mask in schools, regardless of vaccination their status. , Now the updated CDC guidance recommends everyone in schools wear masks., , \"CDC recommends that everyone in K through 12 schools wear a mask indoors, including teachers, staff, students and visitors, regardless of vaccination status. Children should return to full-time, in-person learning in the fall with proper prevention strategies in place,\" Walensky said. \"Finally, CDC recommends community leaders encourage vaccination and universal masking to prevent further outbreaks in areas of substantial and high transmission. With the Delta variant, vaccinating more Americans now is more urgent than ever.\", The updated CDC guidance makes \"excellent sense,\" Dr. David Weber, professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill and board member of the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology, told CNN on Tuesday., \"Breakthrough disease clearly occurs, and for those cases, we know they\'re much more mild in vaccinated people, but we don\'t know how infectious vaccinated people are,\" he said. \"But clearly, if you want to protect your children under 12 or grandchildren, or protect immunocompromised people, as well as protect your own health -- from even mild disease -- then you should be wearing a mask, particularly in areas of high transmission when indoors.\", Guidance has been in talks for days, The last time the CDC updated its mask guidance was two months ago, to say most people who are fully vaccinated could go without masks indoors. That guidance moved so quickly that administration officials were informed less than a day before -- and many public health experts were taken by surprise., This time, the CDC\'s updated guidance has been expected for some days now., As the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant continues to circulate across the United States, top federal health officials debated whether to issue new guidance on masks, huddling on Sunday night to go over the new data and evidence regarding the transmissibility of the variant and breakthrough cases among vaccinated people, according to a person familiar with the talks. , , The CDC emphasized on Tuesday that while some breakthrough cases have occurred, getting vaccinated still prevents severe illness, hospitalization and death. The CDC also noted that the highest spread of Covid-19 cases and severe outcomes is happening in areas with low vaccination rates and among unvaccinated people., \"There are many reasons for getting vaccinated -- keeping you from dying, keeping you from being hospitalized, protecting loved ones, as well as not ending up with permanent symptoms, potentially like loss of sense of smell and taste and confusion that may last for a prolonged period of time,\" Weber said. , \"There are many reasons still to get vaccinated. Even if under certain circumstances, it\'s recommended you wear your mask,\" he said. \"The CDC and others will be flexible and if we can achieve higher percentages of vaccination and drive the rate of infections back down again, then the recommendation will go back to saying if you\'re vaccinated, you don\'t need a mask -- but I don\'t see that for a substantial period of time.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/27/health/cdc-mask-guidance-vaccinated-people-bn/index.html',1,39),(33,'Casual relationships matter for older adults','In May, Vincent Keenan traveled from Chicago to Charlottesville, Virginia, for a wedding -- his first trip out of town since the start of the pandemic.\"Hi there!\" he called out to customers at a gas station where he\'d stopped on his way to the airport. \"How\'s your day going?\" he said he asked the Transportation Security Administration officer who checked his ID. , \"Isn\'t this wonderful?\" he exclaimed to guests at the wedding, most of whom were strangers., \"I was striking up conversations with people I didn\'t know everywhere I went,\" said Keenan, 65, who retired in December as chief executive officer of the Illinois Academy of Family Physicians. \"Even if they just grunted at me, it was a great day.\", , , It wasn\'t only close friends Keenan missed seeing during 15 months of staying home and trying to avoid Covid-19. It was also dozens of casual acquaintances and people whom he ran into at social events, restaurants, church and other venues., These relationships with people we hardly know or know only superficially are called \"weak ties\" -- a broad and amorphous group that can include your neighbors, your pharmacist, members of your book group or fellow volunteers at a nearby school., Like Keenan, who admitted he\'s an unabashed extrovert, many older adults are renewing these connections with pleasure after losing touch during the pandemic., Casual relationships have several benefits, according to researchers who\'ve studied them. These ties can cultivate a sense of belonging, provide bursts of positive energy, motivate us to engage in activities, and expose us to new information and opportunities -- all without the emotional challenges that often accompany close relationships with family and friends., , , Multiple studies have found that older adults with a broad array of \"weak\" as well as \"close\" ties enjoy better physical and psychological well-being and live longer than people with narrower, less diverse social networks. Also, older adults with broad, diverse social networks have more opportunities to develop new relationships when cherished friends or family members move away or die., \"Feeling connected to other people, not just the people who are closest to you, turns out to be incredibly important,\" said Gillian Sandstrom, a senior lecturer in the department of psychology at the University of Essex in England., Sandstrom\'s research has found that people who talk to more acquaintances on a daily basis tend to be happier than people who have fewer of these interactions. Even talking to strangers makes people feel less lonely and more trusting, she has discovered., , , Claire Lomax, 76, of Oakland, California, who\'s unmarried, has made a practice of chatting with strangers all her life. Among her greatest pleasures in recent years was volunteering at the Oakland Police Department, where she would ask patrol officers about their families or what was happening at the station., \"I never wanted a man of my own, but I like to be around them,\" she explained. \"So, I got to have my guy buzz without any complications, and I felt recognized and appreciated,\" Lomax said. Since becoming fully vaccinated, she\'s volunteering in person at the police stations again -- a deep source of satisfaction for her., Even people who describe themselves as introverts enjoy the positivity that casual interactions can engender., \"In fact, people are more likely to have purely positive experiences with weak ties\" because emotional complications are absent, said Katherine Fiori, chair of the psychology department at Adelphi University in Garden City, New York., , , Lynn Eggers, 75, a retired psychologist who lives in Minneapolis, loved going to coffee shops and the gym before Covid-19 hit. \"In both places, you can be in a group and alone,\" she said. \"You can choose to talk to someone or not. But you feel you\'re part of the community.\", At a nearby light-rail station, Eggers would strike up conversations with strangers: two police officers who told her about growing up in Somalia, a working-class Texan whose daughter won a scholarship to Harvard University, a young Vietnamese woman whose parents worried she was abandoning her culture., When Eggers stopped taking public transportation for fear of Covid-19, she missed \"getting these glimpses into other ways of seeing the world.\" Instead, she started chatting with neighbors in daily walks around her neighborhood -- another way to feel connected., Many people may have found that neighbors, mail carriers and delivery people became more important during the pandemic -- simply because they were around when others were not, said Karen Fingerman, a professor of human ecology at the University of Texas at Austin. As pandemic restrictions lift, \"the key is to get out in daily life again\" and reengage with a variety of people and activities, she recommended., , , , , Helen Bartos, 69, a retired clinical psychologist, lives in a condominium community in Rochester, New York. \"With Covid, a whole group of us started getting together outside,\" she said. \"We\'d bring out chairs and drinks, wear masks, and sit around and talk. It was very bonding. All of these people are neighbors; now I would call some of them friends.\", Ellie Mixter-Keller, 66, of Milwaukee, turned to social gatherings sponsored by the activity group Meetup six years ago after a divorce disrupted her life. \"It was my salvation. It exposed me to a bunch of new people who I didn\'t have to date or have to dinner,\" she said. Now that she\'s fully vaccinated, she\'s busy almost every night of the week attending Meetup events and informal get-togethers arranged by people she\'s met., In some cases, varying views of covid vaccines have made casual interactions more difficult. Patty Beemer, 61, of Hermosa Beach, California, used to go swing-dancing two to three times a week before the pandemic. \"It\'d be 20 seconds of chitchat and just dance\" before all those events were canceled, she said., , , In the past several months, however, the swing-dance community in and around Los Angeles has split, with some events requiring proof of vaccination and others open to everyone., \"Before, everyone danced with everyone, without really thinking about it. Now, I don\'t know if it\'s going to be like that.

So, many programs will test a certain proportion of students and staff every week., \"It\'s not uncommon to say, test 20% of people, once a week and then another 20% another week -- but the specific details of how the programs work are variable.\" , In March, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced $10 billion for states to help implement coronavirus surveillance testing in K-12 schools across the country. , Some health officials and school districts are mulling over how to use some of those dollars -- and what type of testing should be conducted, such as screening with rapid antigen tests versus diagnostic PCR tests, and how often., Polymerase chain reaction tests, known as PCR, are the most common and most accurate tests for determining whether someone currently has a coronavirus infection. Antigen tests are a quick and easy way to detect the presence of a specific viral antigen and generally have similar specificity but are less sensitive than most PCR tests. A Covid-19 rapid test can cost about $75, according to the University of Rochester Medical Center, and a Covid-19 diagnostic test can cost around $150., \"Diagnostic testing is for people who have symptoms of a disease, whereas screening testing is for asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections,\" Branch-Elliman said. \"The presence of symptoms dramatically increases the chances that a disease is present, and so the usefulness of the test for finding real cases changes.\", Early in the pandemic,\" we didn\'t have enough tests or supplies,\" Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN on Wednesday. , Now, \"testing is emerging once again as a really key priority area, especially with the rise in variants coupled with variable vaccination rates,\" Freeman said. \"So, the testing has to come back to the forefront, or we\'re not going to be able to even understand where and how to target the mitigation efforts community by community.\", Most schools and jurisdictions are balancing decisions around testing with plans for other mitigation measures, such as physical distancing, wearing masks and vaccines -- but Freeman said that there is also concern around what to do if a positive case is detected, which may require more resources to trace the contacts of the infected person and test them., \"It\'s not just testing -- as soon as you find that positive, you have to do something,\" Freeman said. \"You have to begin contact tracing, you have to notify, you have to isolate or quarantine, and you have to worry about everybody they were exposed to, whether it was everybody on a school bus, a playground, or a school gym.\", Most school officials, public health experts and political leaders agree that Covid-19 testing can play a big role in keeping students safe and monitoring for any disease spread. But there has been emerging debate around what testing plans should look like -- and some argue that testing should be used to keep kids in school, not cancel classes because of a Covid-19 case., Rapid testing and isolation, A pre-print paper, published online Thursday by researchers at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, suggests that daily Covid-19 testing of students and staff who were the contacts of someone in school with the disease can be a tool to keep them in school rather than have them quarantine. The study has not been peer reviewed., The study of about 200 schools in the UK, found that rates of Covid-19 among school-based contacts were less than 2%. The study notes that schools had Covid-19 precautions in place during the trial, but routine mask use was discontinued part way through the trial in May., \"It is always going to be tricky to define the relative effectiveness of isolation versus testing, as there are a lot of assumptions that need to be made. That aside, what this study shows is that daily testing rather than isolation of contacts is effective in preventing onward transmission,\" Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said in a statement released by the UK-based Science Media Centre.   , \"Crucially, it also highlights the unnecessary disruption that isolation rules have had on countless numbers of children,\" Ball said. \"Isolation of contacts is an important weapon in infection control, but it is also crude. Rapid testing circumvents needless isolation, and it should be used more widely.\", However, \"introducing the testing policy did not substantially change Covid related absences -- although it was lower in the arm with testing, the difference was too small to be confident that it had not been created by chance,\" Jon Deeks, professor of biostatistics and head of the Biostatistics, Evidence Synthesis and Test Evaluation Research Group at the University of Birmingham, said in a separate statement, adding that the study \"does not provide conclusive findings.\", What CDC recommends, The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who may have been exposed to Covid-19 and are not fully vaccinated should quarantine., \"CDC guidance provides that people who are fully vaccinated do not need to participate in screening testing and do not need to quarantine if they do not have any symptoms; though decisions regarding screening testing may be made at the state or local level,\" the guidance states., Also, CDC guidance notes that schools should consider a \"frequent\" screening testing program for students, teachers and staff who are not fully vaccinated. \"Testing provides an important layer of prevention, particularly in areas with substantial to high community transmission levels,\" according to the guidance., The guidance does not recommend screening students in communities with low transmission, but recommends to offer screening for students who are not fully vaccinated at least once per week in communities with moderate, substantial and high transmission, and at least once per week to teachers and staff who are not fully vaccinated  across all communities., \"One of the things that we have learned over the past year is that a one-size-fits all approach to schools is the wrong one. The answer about how to use testing in schools will depend upon a lot of different things, like how much virus is circulating in the community, how many people are getting hospitalized from Covid in a community, and local vaccine uptake,\" Branch-Elliman said., Pros and cons of testing strategies, Branch-Elliman and her colleagues have been pushing for schools in communities with low transmission of the coronavirus to do away with screening testing altogether and adopt diagnostic tests for people who show Covid-19 symptoms., \"We know that if masks are coming off, other viruses are circulating too. And so it\'s going to be really critical to have diagnostic testing -- say somebody comes to school and they have symptoms, we\'re going to want to know really quickly, do they have Covid and are we going to have to act upon that case? Or do they have just a regular cold?\" she said. \"The answers and what we do are very different depending on what the results of that diagnostic test are.\", Branch-Elliman and two other Boston-based infectious disease physicians and epidemiologists wrote in the US News &amp; World Report this month that schools should not \"blindly screen\" students, but rather implement diagnostic testing programs., \"As the pandemic evolves, policies -- including school testing policies -- need to evolve along with it. We argue that screening should not be conducted in schools where in-school transmission is expected to be low,\" wrote Branch-Elliman and Drs. Elissa Perkins and Shira Doron., \"We believe that free, easily accessible diagnostic testing with a short turnaround time for results remains essential and should be incorporated into policy, planning and contracts for the upcoming school year. Screening testing, on the other hand, should be used sparingly -- if at all.\" , Everyone in the pool, In their op-ed, the doctors praised the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education for developing a pooled testing program for the school year, which involves mixing several test samples together in a \"batch\" or \"pool\" to test all at once for asymptomatic cases. , One study, published this month in the journal EClinicalMedicine, found that pooled testing of saliva samples self-collected by students, faculty and staff across 93 K-thru-12 schools and 18 universities was able to detect coronavirus infections comparable to nasal swabs. Pool sizes of up to 24 samples were tested over a 20-week period., \"Pooling samples substantially reduced the costs associated with PCR testing and allowed schools to rapidly assess transmission and adjust prevention protocols as necessary,\" the researchers, mostly from New York, wrote in the study. \"In one instance, in-school transmission of the virus was determined within the main office and led to review and revision of heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems.\", Another study, published in April in the journal Science Translational Medicine, suggests that pooled testing can identify up to 20 times as many true positive cases as individual testing with a given budget., The American Academy of Pediatrics told CNN that it does not recommend a particular type of test and there is no data on which tests are used most often in schools., \"There is no good surveillance to know which tests are most used but rapid antigen tests are in general easier to use on a regular basis, although they do have a higher risk of providing false positive results, and should always be backed up by an FDA EUA approved PCR test if the rapid antigen test returns positive,\" Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, chief of Stanford University School of Medicine\'s division of pediatric infectious diseases and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, told CNN in an email on Friday., \"Pooled testing can be one good option if schools decide to do routing surveillance testing. The benefits are that the tests can be batched and run together, decreasing time to getting results and potentially decreasing cost of testing,\" Maldonado said. \"The major drawback is that pooled testing is best used in low prevalence settings, because if there is a positive pool then all of the individual samples in that \'batch\' have to be disaggregated and tested individually to identify the actual positive sample or samples.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/26/health/covid-19-testing-in-schools-debate-wellness/index.html',1,44),(35,'Moderna to expand size of Covid-19 vaccine trial for younger children, expects to seek EUA in late 2021 or early 2022','Moderna will expand the size of its Covid-19 vaccine trial in younger children, the company said Monday, and will not seek emergency use authorization for the vaccine in that age group until later this year or early next year.\"We are actively discussing a proposal with the FDA. The objective is to enroll a larger safety database which increases the likelihood of detecting rarer events,\" Moderna spokesperson Ray Jordan said in a statement to CNN., The original size of the trial was 6,750 children ages 6 months to 12 years. Moderna did not say how many additional children the trial will now include., Jordan said Moderna would likely seek authorization for the vaccine in \"winter 2021/early 2022.\" Moderna\'s vaccine is currently authorized for people ages 18 and older, and it is seeking authorization for people ages 12 to 17., The New York Times reported on Monday that Pfizer will also expand its vaccine trials in younger children. It cited multiple people familiar with the two companies\' pediatric vaccine trials who said the US Food and Drug Administration found the trials were too small to detect rare side effects., The FDA did not immediately return CNN\'s request for comment., A Pfizer representative told CNN on Monday it has no updates to it previous timelines or details about its pediatric trial. Pfizer noted it began testing its Covid-19 vaccine in people ages 5 to 11 in on June 8 and in those younger than 5 starting on June 21, and said its trial would include up to 4,500 participants in the United States, Finland, Poland and Spain., Pfizer has said it expects initial results of the Phase 2/3 trials in September for children 5 to 11, and results for younger children shortly after., Many parents are eager to vaccinate younger children as schools prepare to open for in-person learning in the fall. Pfizer vaccine is currently authorized for people as young as 12, but there\'s no vaccine available for younger children., President Joe Biden said last week that children under the age of 12 could be eligible to receive a Covid-19 vaccine \"soon,\" predicting the shot could get the green light in the next few months. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN\'s Jim Acosta earlier this month that \"the final decision is going to be up to the FDA. And I would imagine that likely will not happen until we get well into the winter, towards the end of this year.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/26/health/child-vaccine-trials-expand/index.html',1,45),(36,'Parents are hesitant to vaccinate children, but pediatricians might be the key','As back-to-school season approaches, parents are split when it comes to vaccinating their children against Covid-19.   Of parents with unvaccinated children, 3 in 4 say the recommendation of their child\'s health care provider will be integral in their decision to vaccinate. However, 70% of parents with children ages 3 to 11 and 50% of parents with children ages 12 to 18 have not discussed the Covid-19 vaccine with their pediatrician, according to a new report., To get more kids vaccinated, pediatricians must be more proactive in discussing Covid-19 vaccines with parents and addressing their legitimate concerns, said Sarah Clark, codirector of the C.S. Mott Children\'s Hospital National Poll on Children\'s Health, which conducted the survey. , \"There is so much information that has come out about the Covid vaccine, and it\'s coming fast, it\'s coming from a lot of different sources, and it feels overwhelming,\" Clark said. \"You can see why people might feel worried, a little confused and uncertain about what really is the best thing to do.\" , , The report, published Monday, used data from a survey conducted with a national sample of 2,019 adults with at least one child age 3 to 18. , For parents with children ages 12 to 18, 39% said their child already got a Covid-19 vaccine, and 21% said they will likely vaccinate their child, the report found. Another 40% said that it\'s unlikely they will vaccinate their child., For parents of children in the younger age group, 49% said they will likely vaccinate their child against Covid-19 once approved for children under age 12, while 51% said they likely will not. , The report comes roughly two weeks before many schools around the country begin the school year. Only about 38% of adolescents ages 12 to 17 will have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine by then, according to a CNN analysis. About 30% of this population will be fully vaccinated at that time. , A lot of the hesitancy can come down to a lack of communication between parents and pediatricians, Clark said, who is also a research scientist in the department of pediatrics at the Susan B. Meister Child Health Evaluation and Research Center at the University of Michigan., , When the pandemic hit last year, routine checkups and appointments were largely put on hold, she said, so contact between parents and health care providers dropped off. Once in-person care began again, providers were focused on catching up with other vaccinations and services that were missed when medical offices were closed. , This need to catch up on other vaccines and treatment is coupled with the fact that pediatricians did not have access to the Covid vaccine. That means providers were not thinking about discussing the importance of the vaccine with parents early on, Clark added. Conversations about the vaccine should have started long before they became available, and for the younger age bracket, those conversations have to start now. , \"I think they (pediatricians) may have under-appreciated how essential it is for them to have the conversations ahead of time, so when the vaccination does become available for different age groups, families are ready,\" she said. , \'More parent-provider communication needed\', Parents whose children are not yet vaccinated cited that other important factors in their decision are side effects of the vaccine, testing in the child\'s age group, the vaccine\'s efficacy and parents\' own research, according to the report. , , Lower-income parents appear to be more hesitant to vaccinate their children than wealthier parents, the study also found. Across both age groups, fewer parents with a household income of less than $50,000 reported their child already got or is likely to get a Covid vaccine than parents with a household income of more than $100,000. , Lower-income households often correlate to lower levels of education, Clark said, and people with less education can be more susceptible to mistrust or misinformation around vaccines. To address this, health care providers must make parents feel comfortable speaking about their concerns. , \"For people of any income level, but especially people who may be low-income or maybe have lower educational status, the information that\'s out there may be a little hard to put into context,\" Clark said. \"That\'s where relying on your familiar child health provider is going to be really important.\", , The big takeaway is that pediatricians have a responsibility to reach the parents who are hesitant, Clark emphasized. Pediatricians should talk about vaccination at every visit, even sick visits. They should also \"get creative,\" perhaps by setting up video chats that are open to all families in their practice where providers take questions, she said. , Hesitant parents have real questions and concerns, Clark said, and they need to feel comfortable bringing those concerns to their pediatricians and family physicians without feeling judged or labeled \"anti-vaxxers.\" The key is for information to come from trusted people who have cared for these families for a long time, she said., \"It is completely understandable that parents may have questions about the COVID-19 vaccine for their children and teens, especially given the amount of misinformation on social media,\" said Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, via email. , \"Pediatricians are trusted experts and are ready and eager to talk to families about any questions or concerns they may have about the COVID-19 vaccine, or other ways they can keep their family healthy and well during the pandemic. I encourage families to reach out to their pediatrician to have these and other important conversations.\", As an example, Clark offered that a parent might come to the pediatrician with concerns about the side effects being really serious. The pediatrician can then reference past vaccinations they have given to that child and point to the side effects that came from that -- a fever, for example -- and definitively show the vaccine was safe despite the short-term effects. , The point is to put the vaccine in context and in a way that is easy to understand, Clark said., \"They (pediatricians) need to make sure that families know the door is open to conversation,\" she said. \"I think it\'s unreasonable to expect parents to do this on their own.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/26/health/children-covid-vaccine-pediatrician-wellness/index.html',1,46),(37,'Major medical groups call for employers to mandate Covid-19 vaccines for health care workers','As the number of Covid-19 cases surges in the United States, more than 50 health and medical groups -- including the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Public Health Association -- issued a \"Our health care organizations and societies advocate that all health care and long-term care employers require their workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

On Wednesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that employees of all public hospitals and health clinics will be required to get vaccinated or take weekly Covid-19 tests., While overall rates of vaccination among health care workers are higher than in the general population, the organizers of the letter say that 25% of hospital workers have still not been vaccinated. , According to the American Medical Association, 96% of US physicians surveyed in early June said they were fully vaccinated, but the level falls significantly when considering other types of health care workers. The latest numbers from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services finds that as of July 11, just 58% of all nursing home staff are considered to be fully vaccinated., A person is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine or two weeks after a single dose of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine., \"Health care workers have an ethical duty to put patients\' health and well-being first, and getting vaccinated for COVID-19 is integral to that duty,\" Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, vice provost for global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania and organizer of the statement, said in Monday\'s announcement. \"Employer vaccine mandates are effective and lifesaving, and they are especially appropriate in health care and long-term care settings. No patient should have to worry that they could become infected by one of their care providers, and no provider should put their patient at risk.\", The American Nurses Association also signed the joint statement, with ANA President Ernest Grant saying \"Nurses must get vaccinated.\" , \"As the largest group of health care professionals, nurses are critical to all facets of COVID-19 response efforts and must strive to remain physically and psychologically safe to function optimally to care for themselves, their patients and their communities,\" Grant said in a statement., Former US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said Sunday that mandates will be \"the quickest way to get people vaccinated,\" but that won\'t happen more broadly until the vaccines have received full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. Trials and real-world data show the Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective, but they are currently available through FDA emergency use authorization., \"We can\'t have mass mandates, we won\'t -- you\'re hearing this from the military and from other businesses -- until you have full licensure of these vaccines,\" Adams said on CBS on Sunday. \"So if you want to get a bunch of people vaccinated really quickly, get these vaccines licensed, and then you\'ll see the military make it mandatory, you\'ll see businesses make it mandatory.\", According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 49.1% of the US population is fully vaccinated, but vaccination rates have slowed for months.

Cooley received two doses of Pfizer\'s Covid-19 vaccine in February, but blood tests show the shots didn\'t give her antibodies against the virus. , That\'s because, like millions of Americans, Cooley takes medications to suppress her immune system.

The hope was that vaccination rates overall would be so high so that the \"herd\" would protect them.  , But it didn\'t work out that way, because about a third of eligible people in the US have not received even one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. , Monday\'s study in the journal Transplantation looked at infection, hospitalization and death rates for 18,215 fully vaccinated organ transplant patients in the US, Croatia and France. Transplant patients take medications to suppress their immune system so they won\'t reject their new organs.  , The study found that these fully vaccinated organ transplant recipients were 82 times more likely to get a breakthrough Covid-19 infection compared to the vaccinated general population, and 485 times more likely to be hospitalized or die from Covid-19.  , Among the 18,215 transplant patients in the study, 151 had breakthrough infections, 87 were hospitalized with Covid-19 and 14 died from the virus.  , \"This is a stark reminder that there are many vulnerable people around us who have been unable to achieve the same levels of protection that the rest of us have been able to achieve, and as a result are at much higher risk of getting sick or dying from this terrible virus,\" said Dr. Dorry Segev, a transplant surgeon at Johns Hopkins Medicine and lead author of the study.  , Still living a \'quarantined life\' , Those numbers terrify Fred Kolkhorst and his wife, Nancy Marlin, both 68.  , Kolkhorst, a retired professor at San Diego State University, and Marlin, the university\'s former provost, have both received transplants -- a new heart for him and a new kidney for her.  , Blood tests showed that neither developed antibodies after two doses of the Moderna vaccine. Kolkhorst received a third dose of the vaccine, and his antibodies increased, but it\'s unclear if they went up enough to protect him. His wife recently received a third shot, but her doctors tell her it\'s unlikely it will work because of the specific immune suppression drug that she takes.  , The couple live in a county where 71% of the population age 12 and up are fully vaccinated, but they know that might not be enough to fully protect them if their vaccines don\'t work.  , Now the couple has been forced to skip gatherings with family and friends and keep mostly to themselves.  , \"We don\'t go out very much,\" Kolkhorst said. \"We\'re still living a quarantined life, and it\'s been a year and a half.\"   , \'Sometimes you just can\'t fix stupid\' , Kolkhorst has heard unvaccinated people argue that it\'s their right not to get the shot.  , \"It\'s difficult for me to understand how people talk about personal freedoms, but they\'ve impinged on our ability to go out and mingle and be with other people,\" he said. \"I try not to get mad at them, but it\'s so disappointing and frustrating to those of us who can\'t get out and be a part of life without being fearful.\"  , Once, he tried to convince an unvaccinated friend to take the shot. He failed.  , \"Sometimes you just can\'t fix stupid,\" he said.  , Cooley has also had those conversations with family members and friends., They remember when she nearly lost her life to liver failure because of a case of autoimmune hepatitis, and what she went through to get a liver transplant in 2018.  , They know that she takes care of her mother, who is also immunocompromised. They know that her mother\'s mother died of Covid-19 in October.  , And they know how much she wants to hug her nephews. She did hug them back in February, two weeks after her second shot, but that was before three blood tests -- she\'s a part of a study at the University of Mississippi Medical Center -- showed the vaccines did not give her antibodies.  , Even though these friends and relatives know her story, they still refuse to be vaccinated.  , \"In my conversations with them, I say, \'Remember what my life was like before the transplant and during the transplant?

It\'s such a new condition it doesn\'t even have one name, and is also called post-Covid or long haul., There\'s interim guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\'s believed to disproportionately impact Black and Hispanic children. Symptoms can include difficulty in breathing, tiredness, headache, joint pain, sleep problems, mood changes and more, four or more weeks after an initial infection, but most long Covid research has been in adults., \"If you ask me a question about chickenpox, there\'s a lot of detail about chickenpox. It\'s been studied for 70 years, but Covid\'s only been around a year,\" said Dr. Ben Katz, who has treated kids with long Covid as a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children\'s Hospital of Chicago., , Doctors know how to treat the symptoms, Katz said, but there are still many mysteries. , So, Children\'s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., in partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, announced Tuesday that they will start a $40 million study on long Covid and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C. It will be one of several NIH efforts., Dr. Bill Kapogiannis, program director in the NIH\'s Maternal and Pediatric Infectious Disease Branch, said they\'ve been trying to understand MIS-C and also the short, medium, and long term effects of Covid-19 in kids and adults since last spring., , \"We don\'t even have a great definition for it in adults, and about children we don\'t even know what the definition should be of what we\'re looking for,\" Kapogiannis said. , Once scientists agree on a definition, they can look at targets for treatment and prevention., \"You need a very focused, large-scale effort that really has a standardized approach to find the answers,\" he said. , Up to 2,000 young people will be enrolled in the multi-year study announced Tuesday. At least half will have recovered from asymptomatic or symptomatic Covid-19 or MIS-C, a rare complication that can sometimes follow an infection., , Scientists hope the study will help them better understand the long-term physical and mental health impacts after acute illness. The study will also try and determine how often children experience long-term problems from Covid-19, what the risk factors are, and how the disease could impact a child\'s quality of life. , Little is known about why some children have long-term effects from the disease and others don\'t. Many in treatment for long Covid were asymptomatic or had a mild case. At this time, it  appears that severe Covid-19 illness is rare among children. , More than 4 million children and teens have tested positive for Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. It\'s believed anywhere between 2% and 10% have long Covid, but the potential number of children who have long Covid may be much bigger than the number hospitals are treating., , \"I\'m guessing it\'s just the tip of the iceberg,\" said Dr. Alexandra Yonts, an infectious diseases specialist and director of the long Covid clinic that started up in May at Children\'s National Hospital., Since symptoms vary, it may be difficult for parents or pediatricians to notice when a child has this condition. , \"It\'s hard to say you know it definitely is this one thing with these five symptoms, confirmed with this one lab result, because it isn\'t that,\" said Yonts. , For now, hospitals across the country are tailoring treatment to each child. The help can\'t come soon enough., , \"A lot of them come in there with just feeling lost and like they don\'t know what\'s wrong and they\'ve lost everything that was normal about their lives,\" Yonts said., At Yonts\' clinic, to better understand what symptoms doctors need to treat, all patients are screened, get lab work, and then get a multidisciplinary team to address their different symptoms.

A day earlier, county health officials recorded more than 3,000 new Covid-19 infections, for the first time since February. Friday\'s figure was nearly triple what Los Angeles County was recording two weeks ago. , More than 60% of the county\'s eligible population has been fully vaccinated. Without those vaccinations, \"we would probably be seeing almost double the number of cases,\" Barbara Ferrer, the county\'s public health director, said recently. , Hospitalizations are also way up -- with more than 680 hospitalized with Covid-19 on Saturday, Ferrer told CNN. That\'s more than double as many as two weeks ago. , Some of the challenges officials continue to face when it comes to vaccinating people include misinformation, Ferrer told CNN at Ted Watkins Memorial Park, where Covid-19 vaccinations were underway., \"The most two dominant themes today are, \'We don\'t trust the government\'s numbers, we think they\'re not telling us the truth about the vaccine and how safe it is,\'\" she said. , \"We have to work hard with all of our community partners so it\'s not just government that\'s saying how safe the vaccines are, but it\'s the person at your pharmacy who\'s telling you it\'s safe, it\'s your doctor, it\'s your neighbor,\" she said. , Benjamin Jackson was among the people who got vaccinated on Saturday. He said a local nurse provided him information about the vaccine and encouraged him to get a shot., \"We didn\'t want to take the shot, we were scared,\" he said. \"They gave us a lot of information and I told her I was going to come down and get vaccinated.\", Officials across the country have doubled down on efforts to get more Americans vaccinated as the vicious Delta variant continues to fuel a surge in cases and hospitalizations. , To help curb new infections, safety precautions such as mask mandates are once again under consideration in parts of the US. Los Angeles County reinstated its mask mandate last week, and officials said they\'ll keep it in place until Covid-19 numbers improve. , Cases across the US are rising sharply, The Delta variant, believed to be more transmittable and dangerous, accounted for an estimated 83% of coronavirus cases in the US for the two weeks ending July 17, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- a substantial rise from negligible numbers in early May., Cases are rising sharply. The US averaged more than 49,300 new Covid-19 cases a day over the week ending Friday -- a nearly 60% jump from the week prior, and more than four times the lowest average of 2021 (11,299 on June 22), according to data from Johns Hopkins University., Every state reported more cases in the week ending Friday than they did the week before, Johns Hopkins figures show., Health experts have repeatedly pointed to preemptive vaccination as the best way to get ahead of surges due to their proven efficacy, but CDC data Friday showed that the rate of vaccinations continues to slow. The daily average of people becoming fully vaccinated is the lowest it\'s been since the end of January, when the US was just beginning to ramp up its vaccination drive. , Thirty states have yet to fully vaccinate at least half of their residents, with Alabama and Mississippi at less than 35% fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. , In Alabama, Gov. Kay Ivey on Thursday called out \"the unvaccinated folks\" for the rise in Covid-19 cases. \"Folks are supposed to have common sense. But it\'s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks. It\'s the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down,\" she told reporters in Birmingham., With vaccination numbers lagging, officials say more countermeasures against Covid-19 are likely needed., Guidance on mask wearing from the CDC  -- which in May said fully vaccinated Americans can shed their masks -- has not changed, but CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Thursday localities may want to make their own call. , \"Communities and individuals need to make the decisions that are right for them based on what\'s going on in their local areas,\" she said. \"So if you\'re an area that has a high case rate and low rates of vaccination where Delta cases are rising, you should certainly be wearing a mask if you are unvaccinated.\", , Mask mandates are met with opposition, Amid the rising numbers of infections, some state and local leaders are now recommending that masks to be worn indoors even by those who are vaccinated., Health officials in Seattle and King County in Washington noted Friday that the Delta variant\'s prevalence in the US was 1.4% on May 13 when the CDC lifted mask requirements for vaccinated people. Right now, Delta makes up 56% of King County\'s known infections and the figure is expected to rise., \"I know this is frustrating and maybe disappointing to many, it certainly is to me,\" Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for the Seattle and King County public health department said Friday., \"And I acknowledged that the change in communication,\" he said, \"has been a real problem nationally, but we in public health have an obligation to be realistic about the changing situation and provide the best guidance possible.\", Officials in St. Louis, Missouri, have gone one step further by instituting an indoor mask mandate at public settings beginning on Monday, joining Los Angeles County as one of the first areas in the country to reinstate such measures. , Missouri has one of the highest rates of average new daily cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University data., \"The new rule will require everyone age five and over, including those who are vaccinated, to wear a mask. Wearing masks outdoors, especially in group settings, will be strongly encouraged,\" according to a statement from the mayor\'s office. Exceptions are included for those seated and eating at bars and restaurants. , \"We\'ve lost more than 500 St. Louisans to Covid-19, and if our region doesn\'t work together to protect one another, we could see spikes that overwhelm our hospital and public health systems,\" said Dr. Fredrick Echols, acting director of health for the City of St. Louis. , However, Missouri State Attorney General Eric Schmitt said on Friday that he will be going to court to stop the requirement., \"The citizens of St. Louis and St. Louis County are not subjects — they are free people. As their Attorney General I\'ll be filing suit Monday to stop this insanity,\" Schmitt said in a statement on Twitter. , Officials elsewhere are also pushing back against proposed indoor mandates. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey encouraged people in his state to get the vaccine, thanking \"the miracle of modern science\" but reiterated that he will not allow vaccine or mask mandates., In Texas, Austin Mayor Steve Adler says if he could \"order all children and teachers to mask without ending up in court\" he \"would do it in a heartbeat,\" as Austin Public Health reported the daily average number of Covid-19 hospitalizations has more than tripled since July 4. , Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, however, issued an executive order in May prohibiting state governmental entities such as counties from requiring mask-wearing.,  , Safety restrictions are instituted for new school year, With the new school year around the corner -- and vaccine access only available to those over the age of 12 -- some districts are preparing for a return to classes with mask mandates. , Washington DC Public Schools, Boston Public Schools, and Wisconsin\'s Madison Metropolitan School District are among those that recently announced the requiring of masks worn by students and staff inside school buildings., Yet other locales, such as Texas and Iowa, have prevented officials from exercising local control by requiring masks. , Last week, California had announced strict statewide measures for masks in classrooms, yet changed its stance hours later and allowed for local decision-making. For now, the state will require masks but leave decisions on how to handle the enforcement of the mask requirement up to the districts., \"California\'s school guidance will be clarified regarding masking enforcement, recognizing local schools\' experience in keeping students and educators safe while ensuring schools fully reopen for in-person instruction,\" read the update, which was released via a California Department of Public Health tweet., Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described California\'s requirement for masks in schools. The state will require masks but will leave decisions on how to handle the enforcement of the mask requirement up to the districts.

Given there were few or no spectators allowed for these games, there were no fans on the plane wearing country colors, speaking excitedly in different languages or exchanging their picks on favored athletes. It was quiet, serene and lonely., My days prior to departure were filled with detailed planning and lots of testing: a Covid test within 96 hours of departure, and again within 72 hours of departure. Another one immediately upon arrival, and again daily for the duration of my stay. Each time, the possibility of a breakthrough infection lurking in the back of my mind, forcing me into isolation and my team into quarantine for an extended and unplanned stay., A logistical nightmare, Even under the best of circumstances, planning to host the Olympic games is one of the most challenging logistical events on the planet. In the middle of an unfolding pandemic, it seemed nearly impossible. On top of that, local support for the games is anemic: Nearly 8 in 10 Japanese citizens said they preferred to cancel the games altogether in their home country, according to a recent poll. Many here feel the decision to hold them is irresponsible, because of the health risks involved with having, in essence, tens of thousands of potentially infected out-of-towners arriving on your doorstep in the middle of a pandemic., But after postponing the games for a year, the Japanese government and the International Olympics Committee decided the show -- the games -- must go on., And so they are -- but they\'re very different: strange and eerily quiet., When I attended one of the first competitions, the women\'s soccer match between the United States and Sweden on Wednesday, there were only about 50 spectators allowed in the stadium built for 48,000. There was no traffic on the streets, no vendors, and no lines. There were handwashing stations, temperature checks and plexiglass partitions -- all of which probably make only a small difference controlling this particular virus. There was no proof of vaccination required either. The most effective measure was the absolute requirement for masks, which security diligently checked to make sure were properly fitted around our mouth and nose., There was distant fan noise piped in and a smattering of applause after remarkable plays. The only time there was any significant noise was when a team scored. That is when the music blared -- so loudly it was as if they forgot to turn down the volume, given it no longer had to compete with the tens of thousands of cheering fans. During this match, that thunderous music played three times, every time for Sweden. Final score 3-0., Let the games begin, , On the night of the opening ceremonies, it was a flurry to get into the stadium. Protests echoed from around the outside, but once I got in, the full beauty of architect Kengo Kuma\'s creation sunk in., Majestic and perfectly placed under a delightful night sky, it was filled with years of past planning and future potential., It was a caged animal raring to run. On its biggest night, the night of the Opening Ceremony, however, it is tame, quiet and slumbering. You could almost imagine all the amazing events it will contain, full of cheering voices and smiling faces. Just not tonight., Still, that didn\'t take away from watching the athletes parade out country by country, waving to a nonexistent crowd, but still with smiles emitting from underneath their masks. Fireworks illuminated rows and rows of empty seats. It was a study in contrast. A public health emergency that was at the same time a mental health balm., Over the next 16 days, more than 11,000 athletes from just over 200 countries, states and territories are expected to compete. That is, if they don\'t test positive beforehand. As of Friday, there were at least 110 confirmed cases linked to the games. The infected include officials, contractors and of course athletes, like US alternate gymnast Kara Eaker and tennis player Coco Gauff, and three members of South Africa\'s soccer team., Most of the cases were caught before the infected people reached the Olympic Village -- which officials hope to keep bubbled off as much as possible from the rest of society. As you might imagine, however, a bubble of that size, filled with exuberant, young athletes excited to see each other and eager to compete, is challenging to maintain. And, so it is hardly a surprise that a handful of cases have also been detected in the village, including the three members of the soccer team. This led to about 20 other Olympic Villagers being identified as \"close contacts\" and subjected to additional testing and quarantine measures., While Tokyo is in a state of emergency through August 22 (well past the Closing Ceremony) because of the recent surge in cases and overall low vaccination rates among the Japanese, everyone is in a state of mild anxiety. Old friends greet each other from a distance, unsure of handshakes and hugs, their greetings muffled by masks., The number of new infections in Tokyo has been steadily climbing since mid-June. New positive cases hit a 7-day daily average of 1,386 on Thursday, after hovering around an average of about 400 cases per day in mid-June., Some of that anxiety worsened when Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto said Tuesday he would not rule out an 11th-hour cancellation of the Games amid rising Covid-19 cases. It was a surprising statement given how close the games were to starting., When I visited with Dr. Itaru Nishizuka at one of Tokyo\'s largest community health centers, he thought the games would almost certainly go on, with one important caveat. The only thing that might change his prediction: a surge in hospitalizations that would overwhelm the city\'s roughly 400-ICU bed capacity. He said currently about 200 of those beds are occupied. Hospitalization have been steadily increasing, from 1,625 at the start of July to 2,558 on Wednesday., The game plan, I think it\'s fair to say the pandemic has been giving the Japanese government and the International Olympic Committee a fair amount of heartburn since it first reared its head. Early hope that the pandemic would blow over and the games could be held as normal burned as bright as the Olympic torch but were quickly extinguished as wave after wave of Covid-19 surges washed over the planet., So Olympic and government officials devised a pandemic playbook to make the games as safe as possible -- even if they were always under threat of being cancelled outright., While we have seen other sport leagues in the United States and abroad make it through seasons or tournaments safely and with little interruption -- such as the National Football League, the National Basketball League, Wimbledon, the Australian Open -- the Olympics bring a unique challenge, with athletes coming from far and wide, and traveling great distances at different time points to do so., And then there was the novel coronavirus itself. \"We had no idea what was coming to us in terms of Covid,\" Dr. Brian McCloskey, chair of the independent expert panel advising the IOC on Covid-19 countermeasures, told me recently. He said when the decision was made to postpone the Olympics to 2021, everyone was only just learning about how the virus behaved and what worked and didn\'t work to mitigate the risk of spread., But McCloskey said postponing the Olympics again was not an option because of international sports schedules, so it was either cancellation or up to him and his team to figure how to hold the games \"safely and securely\" in 2021., Part of that strategy involved sequestering the athletes as much as possible from the local population. That\'s why nearly all spectators, both local and from abroad, have been banned in Tokyo, and athletes\' movements are mostly confined to the Olympic Village and the venues., \"The athletes aren\'t travelling around Tokyo. They\'re not using public transports. They\'re using designated transports to go from the village to their training or competition venues, and back again,\" McCloskey said during a news conference Monday., Beyond that strategy, McCloskey says the rest comes down to the pillars of public health. \"Physical distancing, wearing a mask, and hand hygiene -- they were always at the fundamental core of what we knew would reduce the risk of Covid during the games. And then we started to layer on top of that the testing strategy that we now have,\" he said., The testing is extensive, along with careful tracking and tracing. Like me, athletes were tested twice, within 96 and 72 hours of departure, and upon arrival, then are given antigen tests daily. If anyone tests positive, a PCR test is used to confirm the result and they are immediately isolated. Any \"close contact\" is subject to quarantine., Does the playbook miss the point?, But even that has not quelled the concern from both locals and health experts. \"One of the things that has been a concern is that they really planned this Olympics around the concept of hygiene theater,\" said Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota., \"Originally, the plans were set up counting on this largely being a respiratory droplet -- i.e. falling within three to six feet of the individual who might be infected -- when in fact, as we now know, the primary means for transmission is actually through airborne transmission, aerosols, things that float in the air, like cigarette smoke,\" Osterholm told me., Linsey Marr, an engineering professor at Virginia Tech and an expert in how viruses behave in the air, said that cigarette smoke is a great way to visualize the most up-to-date understanding of how the virus lingers and how easily it can be spread. \"Because it comes from our mouths and carries particles that are similar in size and behavior to the virus,\" she said., If you imagine an infected person exhaling the virus as smoke and watching that vapor drift easily in the air, it will forever change how you think about protecting yourself and others., The much more contagious Delta variant, which has grown at least seven-fold in Japan since the start of June, compounds the problem., \"So before, it was like an infected person was smoking one small cigarette at a time, but now it\'s like they\'re smoking a few cigarettes at once because we think they shed more virus. More smoke means that more will still be in the room even after the person has left. After the person leaves, the smoke becomes diluted as outdoor air replaces some of the indoor air, but if there was more to begin with, then there will be more 15 minutes after the person leaves,\" Marr said., Osterholm said that shift in thinking makes barriers like plexiglass separators in places like the athletes\' workout areas ineffective, but face masks even more important. And like others, he\'s also worried about the Delta variant., \"We had real concerns about the potential for transmission at the Olympics well before Delta as a variant took hold around the world. When that did happen, it only heightened our concern,\" he said., Right now, the IOC playbook states that a face mask must be worn at all times, except when training, competing, eating, drinking, sleeping or during interviews. But even that is incomplete, according to Osterholm, because there is no specification for what type of mask should be worn, other than \"non-fabric where possible.\", \"We already know the limited protection cloth masks provide versus N95s. [Officials] have provided no clear directions. They should be recommending N95 respirators,\" Osterholm says., Vaccines are another crucial tool against Covid, but they are not required because the independent expert panel thought doing so could have created profound issues of inequity., \"We were fairly confident that we would have a vaccine by now. But we also knew if we had one, it wouldn\'t be equally available around the world [and] wouldn\'t necessarily be in good supply,\"  McCloskey explained., Also, it would be hard to justify an athlete receiving a vaccine when vulnerable people or health care workers in their home countries did not yet have access. Remember, in Africa, just over 1% of the population has been fully vaccinated. And in Haiti, the vaccination program began just last week. Those facts are a brutal reminder that while the United States is dealing with high levels of vaccine hesitancy, most of the developing world is begging for access to the shots. My colleague Christine Brennan told me nearly 100 athletes from the United States chose not to get vaccinated before arriving., Despite the lack of a vaccine mandate, the IOC estimates more than 80% of residents of the Olympic Village will be vaccinated -- above the estimated threshold needed for herd immunity.  McCloskey said they\'re a \"bonus extra layer on top of the others, to give us even more reassurance.\", The world watches and waits with bated breath, All of these measures have not cleared the metaphorical cloud that continues to hang over the city as the world waits to see how this global event will fare in the face of a pandemic. The major question looming is: Will these now-small number of positive cases show that the protocols outlined in the playbook are working, or will the numbers spike up, underscoring the feeling that holding the Olympics was ill-advised in the first place? Only time will tell., McCloskey is feeling optimistic. \"What we\'re seeing is what we expected to see. Essentially, if I thought all the tests that we did were going to be negative, then I wouldn\'t bother doing the tests in the first place. We do the pretest because they are a way of filtering out people who might be developing an infection,\" he said during a Monday news conference., But others are not so sure. \"Visitors, athletes, journalists, delegates -- of course they are supposed to be within the bubble, but it\'s not working well. It\'s obvious that the bubble system is kind of broken, so there seems to be some sort of interaction between guests and visitors and also local people,\" public health expert Dr. Kenji Shibuya said in an interview with Reuters earlier this week., Dr. Ishizuka, who is also waiting with bated breath, is steadfast in his recommendation that the Olympics continue., \"Japan needed this,\" he told me. \"In 1964, the last Tokyo Olympics, because Japan lost the war, the games worked as an opportunity for us to come back. In this Olympics, we have Fukushima,\" he said emotionally, referring to the 2011 earthquake and ensuing tsunami which led to a nuclear disaster. In total, more than 22,000 people went missing or died., That the potential for healing mental and emotional health comes at the risk of physical health is a sentiment Osterholm understands as well., \"We want the Olympics to happen, the world wants them to happen,\" Osterholm said. \"This is something we need desperately for the world psyche, but at the same time, they have to be safe. If in fact we see spreading events occur associated with the Olympics, that will be a mark that will last forever.\", For now, at least the athletes get to come and live out their dream, even if family and other members of their delegation have to sit out the games at home. Many have worked for a good part of their lives to reach this pinnacle. And, of course, we the spectators look forward to watching the best competitors in our favorite sport vie for gold.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/24/health/olympics-during-pandemic-gupta/index.html',1,53),(42,'Missouri health care CEO trying to reach the unvaccinated says people are dying unnecessarily','Steve Edwards, the president and CEO of a health care system in Missouri, is troubled that health experts cannot seem to inspire more people to get vaccinated in his area, which is being hit hard by the Edwards, of Springfield-based Cox Health, told CNN on Friday that his system has had 534 Covid-19 patients die, with more than 100 of those deaths after vaccines became widely available. None of the patients who died were vaccinated., He is desperately trying to figure out how to get through to people., \"If I knew how I was missing the mark, we could correct and change,\" he told CNN\'s Alisyn Camerota. The community needs 80 to 90% of people to get immunity either from getting inoculated or catching the virus, he said., \"We\'re not nearly halfway there. This will roar on for quite some time,\" he said., He said he thinks the vaccine hesitancy stems from mistrust of the government or institutions. He said doctors have seen patients who didn\'t get a vaccine because it is under emergency use authorization who ask for monoclonal antibodies -- that are also available under an EUA., \"Someone got into their head that the vaccine is not safe,\" he said. \"It might be the safest vaccine in the history of man. And we somehow have not overcome that.\", Edwards said he feels guilty because he is the most prominent voice in the local health care community and people continue to die unnecessarily. He struggles because he thinks his voice could be heard better and he could have save some lives. , \"Every vaccine can save a life,\" he said., US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said he is concerned because the Delta variant of coronavirus is spreading quickly among unvaccinated people, who account for the vast majority of coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths nationwide., \"The thing that\'s making this possible is the fact that we are dealing with the most transmissible version of Covid-19 that we\'ve seen to date,\" he said., Despite being shown an AP-NORC poll that suggests 45% of people will definitely not get vaccinated, Murthy said: \"Well, I\'m certainly not giving up on making sure that we continue to work hard to get people vaccinated and I don\'t think that we\'ve actually reached the limit (on vaccine outreach) yet. , \"Every day more than half a million people are making the active choice to get vaccinated. That\'s a lot of people ... and so we are making progress. We just want to make faster progress.\", , Rise in hospitalizations is self-inflicted wound, expert says, Health experts blame the recent surges in Covid-19 cases on the low rate of vaccinations. And now the accelerating Delta variant is threatening to increase hospitalizations and deaths as well, one expert said Thursday., \"This is a self-inflicted wound, because we can prevent all of those hospitalizations and deaths -- or at least 98, 99% of them -- if we can encourage vaccination,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN\'s Jim Acosta., More than 91 million people live in a county considered to have high Covid-19 transmission, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Every state on Friday had a seven-day average of new cases higher than the week before, according to data from Johns Hopkins University., Yet, despite the warnings from health experts, the daily pace of people becoming fully vaccinated keeps falling. It\'s now the lowest it\'s been since the end of January, when the US had only been vaccinating for about six weeks, according to CDC data., The US government has purchased an additional 200 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, BioNTech said in a news release Friday. More than half should arrive by the end of the year, and the rest by May of next year. That would bring to 500 million the total number of doses supplied by Pfizer., Only 48.9% of the US population is fully vaccinated, and the seven-day average pace is around 249,000. The average hasn\'t been above 500,000 fully vaccinated people per day since July 5, according to CDC data., \"We\'re all thinking that another surge is likely,\" said Dr. Christian Sandrock, director of critical care at UC Davis Medical Center, in a statement Thursday. \"It is frightening. I don\'t think we\'ll go back to the worst we\'ve seen, due to the vaccine, but it\'s hard to tell.\", UC Davis epidemiology professor Lorena Garcia said the impact could be extremely devastating on rural communities with lower vaccination rates and limited access to care., Alabama has the lowest rate of vaccinations at 33.9%, CDC numbers reveal. Mississippi has also vaccinated less than 35%., After a news conference Thursday, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey encouraged people to get vaccinated. , \"These folks are choosing a horrible lifestyle of self-inflicted pain,\" she said. \"It\'s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks. It\'s the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down.\", In Missouri, additional personnel and equipment are being sent to Springfield-Greene County to support the local health care system, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson announced Thursday., A return to masks, Some regions are returning to masks in the hopes of slowing the spread. , In Texas, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo warned that the region is \"at the beginning of a potentially very dangerous fourth wave of this pandemic\" and raised the threat level from yellow to orange, urging community members to wear masks. , \"So, I know they\'re uncomfortable, I don\'t like wearing masks either, but until we get the numbers back down, let\'s all wear masks again,\"  the judge said of the county that includes Houston, the nation\'s fourth most populous city., Masks are recommended indoors for all vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, according to Austin-Travis County\'s Covid-19 risk-based guidelines. Austin Mayor Steve Adler says if he could \"order all children and teachers to mask without ending up in court,\" he \"would do it in a heartbeat.\", Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order in May prohibiting state governmental entities such as counties from requiring that masks be worn., The number of hospitalizations has crossed the threshold of over 30 admissions per day, officials say., The CDC still recommends that unvaccinated people wear masks, but the choice is up to the individual if they are vaccinated, Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Thursday. , \"If you are vaccinated, you get exceptional protection from the vaccines, but you have the opportunity to make the personal choice to add extra layers of protection if you so choose,\" she said., , Experts express concern even for vaccinated Americans, Experts are warning that even people who are vaccinated need to be concerned about the surge. , \"If there\'s all kinds of virus around you, if you\'re in a community with a lot of virus, then because these vaccines are not 100%, it is going to impact you,\" CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper on Thursday., , At this time of the summer, transmission rates should be low, said CNN\'s Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, speaking on the same show. In the warm weather of July, people are primarily socializing outside, where the virus is less likely to spread, he said., Come the drier, colder weather of the fall and winter, transmission rates might go up even more, Gupta added., \"So, this could be as good as it gets at least for a period of time,\" he said. , For people who are vaccinated, their immune systems are much better equipped to protect them against the virus, but not perfect, Gupta said. Some might not get symptoms if they are infected, but some might end up being protected from hospitalization and still get sick, he said., Wen compared vaccination to wearing a seat belt: it is a crucial layer of protection, but it is not foolproof against the reckless behavior of others., \"But saying that doesn\'t mean undermining confidence in seat belts. It just saying that the choices that other people are making influence us, too,\" Wen said. , , Vaccine effectiveness against Delta, Walensky said Thursday that the Delta variant is an \"aggressive and much more transmissible\" strain of the virus., \"It is one of the most infectious respiratory viruses we know of, and I have seen in my 20-year career,\" Walensky said at a White House Covid-19 briefing., The spread of the variant makes vaccination even more important, Walensky said., \"If you are not vaccinated, please take the Delta variant seriously. This virus has no incentive to let up, and it remains in search of the next vulnerable person to infect,\" she said., According to CDC data released earlier this week, the Delta variant represents an estimated 83% of all coronavirus samples sequenced in the last two weeks. The good news is data shows vaccines are working as they did in clinical trials against the variant, Walensky said., Dr. Celine Gounder, who served on President Joe Biden\'s transition Covid-19 advisory board, said the variant might mean people need more measures to protect themselves., \"At the beginning of the pandemic, the CDC said that a close contact was somebody that you\'re indoors with unmasked for 15 minutes or more,\" Gounder said in an interview with STAT published Friday. \"The equivalent of that with the Delta variant is not 15 minutes, it\'s one second.\", Three important measures to fight the variant are vaccines, masks and good ventilation., People should think in terms of how much virus there is in the air, plus how long they might be in contact with that virus-laden air., \"So if you\'re indoors, there\'s not a lot of air dilution unless you\'re opening up windows and doing that sort of thing. When you\'re outdoors, it\'s almost infinitely diluted. And so outdoors, your risk is really low,\" Gounder said., She added that opening windows at home works really well.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/23/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html',1,55),(43,'Tennessee resumes vaccination outreach but with marketing emphasis on parents, not children  ','Tennessee\'s top health official said Friday that vaccination efforts for teens will continue but that marketing efforts would be clearly directed at parents rather than their children.The Tennessee Department of Health announced mid-July that it had stopped outreach on all adolescent vaccines, including the Covid-19 shot. That pause followed the firing of a top vaccine official who said she had distributed a memo saying that some teenagers could be eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine without their parents\' consent., Tennessee Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey told a news conference Friday that the state was focusing its vaccine marketing at parents. , \"The reason that we paused is because we wanted to leave no room for interpretation about where we are shooting, and we are shooting to get the message to parents. And there was a perception that we were marketing to children. And that totally was against our view about the importance of parental authority,\" Piercey said. , \"We strongly believe that parents are the best decision-makers when it comes to medical decisions for their children. And so we took the pause to look at our marketing materials, to look at our fliers and postcards and all of the other public-facing materials to make sure they were appropriately directed at parents.\",  Piercey\'s comments echo those made by Gov. Bill Lee on Thursday where he also reassured the public that vaccination efforts for children will continue but that only parents would be targeted for marketing. , , Piercey\'s statements mark the first time she\'s spoken since Dr. Michelle Fiscus, a top vaccine official, was fired and the health department changed vaccine outreach protocols under pressure from GOP lawmakers. , Tennessee is one of a handful of states that by law allows teens between the ages of 14 and 17 to get medical care, including vaccinations, without parental consent., Fiscus\'s memo on teen vaccinations was based on a 37-year-old state Supreme Court ruling known as the \"mature minor doctrine,\" which allows health care providers to treat minors age 14 and above without parental consent if the providers decide those teenagers are mature enough., CNN had previously reported on internal documents within the agency that issued a new protocol to stop all Covid-19 vaccine events on school property as well as mailing teens postcard reminders for vaccinations. , \"We have not slowed down our vaccination efforts. [As I just mentioned], those efforts to promote not only Covid vaccine, but also all childhood immunizations, do continue,\" Piercey said Friday., Delta surging in state, Piercey warned that Covid-19 was surging in her state, with the Delta variant, establishing a \"stronghold\" in the Memphis and Shelby County areas. , , \"Tennessee is seeing a surge just like essentially every other state in the nation is. Here in Tennessee, we have had over a 200% increase in cases since July 1,\" Piercey said. \"The average per day over the last seven days is about 700 or over 700 cases a day and that continues to grow.\", Piercey said that was similar to the state\'s situation in early May. \"But it is a noticeable uptick and doesn\'t currently show any signs of slowing,\" she said., She said hospitalizations were also increasing. , \"We were under 200 hospitalizations statewide and now we are well over 500 statewide,\" she said. \"We haven\'t seen an uptick yet in deaths, unfortunately that will probably come in the next few weeks.\", Piercey said almost all the cases of severe illness were among the unvaccinated.,  \"About 97% of all of our hospitalizations and 98 plus percent of all of our deaths are among the unvaccinated,\" she said., , , ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/23/health/tennessee-teen-vaccinations-piercey/index.html',1,56),(44,'Delta is dangerous and spreading -- but vaccination can stop it','I\'m hearing from vaccinated people who are frightened about breakthrough cases, the Delta variant and new waves of Covid. But people who are fully vaccinated are not the ones who should be most concerned. As new cases continue to climb almost everywhere, here\'s what I expect to happen over the coming weeks.Globally, we\'re far from the end of the pandemic. Delta is at least two times more contagious than the original strain of the virus, which means that it will infect and kill more people., Many countries that have avoided big surges so far don\'t have access to the vaccines they need to protect their populations. Many of these countries will likely see explosive spread of Covid over the coming weeks and months. Already stressed health systems will become overwhelmed with cases, and many people will get sick and die., But in places with high rates of vaccination, including much of the United States, the worst is over. Though we\'ll likely also see big increases in US cases, future waves won\'t be as deadly. That\'s because 80% of the most vulnerable Americans -- people over age 65 -- are fully vaccinated., Simply put: Fewer vulnerable people means fewer deaths. Whereas the US infection fatality rate before vaccines became available was 1 in 200, that rate could shrink to less than 1 in 500 or even as low as 1 in 1,000 in the coming months because of the strong protection provided by vaccines -- even if we see many breakthrough infections., In places where disease continues to spread, deaths may increase, particularly among adults who are not vaccinated. Because the people most vulnerable to Covid have a high vaccination rate, the increase in deaths will be much smaller than the past horrific increases. But we have to prepare ourselves for the eventuality that more people will die -- some of whom will be young and otherwise healthy., In the months ahead, more cases won\'t correlate to more deaths the same way as earlier in the pandemic. This graph from the UK shows why. Death rates have plummeted, especially among older groups, even as case rates have increased, because most of the elderly are vaccinated. But even though the rates are far lower than they were, people in all age groups are still dying., Vaccines have saved hundreds of thousands of lives already and will save hundreds of thousands more, but they\'re not 100% effective. No vaccine is. They provide great protection -- not perfect protection. More cases will lead to more breakthrough infections, which is expected, but vaccines drastically reduce risk of hospitalization and death from Covid. People who are vaccinated are also less likely to spread the virus, so people around them are safer, although they aren\'t protected completely., When breakthrough infections do occur among vaccinated people, the vast majority are mild. For most, Covid will be no more serious than the common cold. Unfortunately, some breakthrough infections will be less mild, requiring hospitalization and, in rare cases, resulting in death. That doesn\'t change the reality that vaccination is the best way to protect ourselves from Covid., We need better data on severe breakthrough infections, but my guess is that they\'re more likely to occur in people of advanced age or who have serious underlying health conditions such as lung disease or immunosuppression, including immunosuppression from medications. It\'s possible that the mRNA vaccines are more protective against Covid than other vaccines; studies will determine whether this is the case., It is neither necessary nor wise for our public health systems to attempt to track every single breakthrough case that causes no or only mild symptoms. There are simply going to be too many, and there is little benefit to tracking illnesses that are no worse than a cold. Instead, it makes sense -- as is being done -- to do special studies of all breakthrough infections as part of specific population-based studies, and also to try to track every severe Covid illness after vaccination. This should give us much better information about who is most at risk of serious illness from Covid after vaccination, and might lead to different dosing recommendations for some groups., When you see headlines claiming that a significant proportion of hospitalized patients somewhere have been fully vaccinated, don\'t be alarmed. Most of those stories actually underscore the fact that vaccines are working exceptionally well against variants of concern, including Delta. Where most people are vaccinated, most cases will be among the vaccinated., The worst is over in the United States, but, on average, 200-300 people are still dying every day from a disease that didn\'t exist 18 months ago. If that rate continues for the next 12 months, that would total 100,000 deaths -- more, even, than occur each year from diabetes or from the horrific opioid epidemic., Delta is spreading, and in some areas is spreading rapidly. How the virus affects you when you encounter it depends on whether your body has been prepared to recognize and fight it -- or is caught off guard. People who remain unvaccinated should be especially concerned about the rapid rise of Delta, which now makes up at least 83% of sequenced cases in the United States., The more cases there are, the more uncontrolled spread there will be, and the higher the risk that even more dangerous variants can emerge. Variants remain the wild card for the trajectory of the pandemic. Delta may not be the worst strain the virus deals us, but we can reduce the risk of other dangerous variants by vaccinating widely as well as continuing to tamp down spread. Vaccination, masks, ventilation and physical distancing can stop Covid, including Delta., Our slow pace of vaccination has given the virus extra time to adapt and mutate, but we can wrest the advantage back by using the best weapon in our arsenal -- vaccines -- complemented by measures that slow spread of the virus including masking, ventilation and avoiding events that can amplify spread of the virus.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/23/health/delta-variant-danger-frieden/index.html',1,59),(45,'Millions of teens will head back to school unvaccinated','Most teens heading back to school in the coming weeks will be unvaccinated against Covid-19,As many teens across the United States prepare for a return to school this fall, a new CNN analysis finds that less than a third of them are on track to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 in the next two weeks. , , About 7 million adolescents, ages 12 to 17, have been fully vaccinated so far, according to the latest data published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fully vaccinated means two weeks since the completion of a second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine., Based on recent trends, another 600,000 or so adolescents may be fully vaccinated in the next two weeks, around the time many of them may be heading back to school in August. , If that happens, then the number of adolescents fully vaccinated by that time will represent only about 30% of the roughly 25 million 12- to 17-year-olds in the United States. , And only about 38% -- 9.6 million adolescents -- would have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine by the time many schools start in two weeks, according to CNN estimates from CDC data. Many large school systems -- including Atlanta, Fort Myers, Florida, Flagstaff, Arizona, and the entire state of Hawaii -- start school in the first two weeks of August. , , Earlier this week, former CDC acting director Dr. Richard Besser said that the nation must increase \"pressure\" and \"accessibility\" for teens to get vaccinated against Covid-19 in order to make schools safer this fall. , \"As a pediatrician and a parent, I know that the best place for kids to be in terms of their emotional health, in terms of their development, is in school. And I think what we\'ve learned over the past year is that this can be done safely. It can be done safely for children,\" Besser, president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, told CNN\'s Jim Acosta on Monday. , , \"Those who are 12 and older, we have to increase the pressure and the accessibility for those kids to be vaccinated, encouraging them to do that so that middle school and high school could be more like a normal experience,\" Besser said. \"When I see states around the country and some governors saying they\'re not going to promote vaccines for these kids, that I find extremely discouraging, because there is the opportunity to protect those children and those people who have contact with those children if we get on the same page and do what public health is recommending.\" , , Tennessee counts as one of those states. The Tennessee Department of Health confirmed to CNN last week that it is temporarily halting all adolescent vaccine outreach, even for vaccines not related to Covid-19. , Additionally, when reports emerged in May of heart problems possibly linked to coronavirus vaccines in teens, vaccination numbers started to decline. , Vaccinations for 12- to 15-year-olds started out high soon after May 10, when the FDA authorized the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for that age group. In less than one week, 600,000 children in that group were vaccinated, according to data from the CDC. , But the numbers took a nosedive on May 23, the day after media articles appeared about the possible link to the vaccine and myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, in young people. Most cases of myocarditis were mild and typically resolved quickly. , , In June, the US Food and Drug Administration added a warning about the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart, to the fact sheets for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. , Around that same time, Dr. William Schaffner, a longtime vaccine adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CNN that he understood the myocarditis risk might make parents nervous, but that the risk of Covid-19 should make them much more nervous. , \"People think that doing nothing is not a decision,\" he said. \"But not vaccinating your child is a decision, and it\'s a decision that puts them at risk.\" , , Research published in June in the CDC\'s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found that among 204 adolescents hospitalized for Covid-19, there were no deaths but nearly a third were admitted to intensive care units and roughly 5% required invasive mechanical ventilation, CDC researchers wrote in that report, \"Recent increased hospitalization rates and the potential for severe disease reinforce the importance of continued COVID-19 prevention measures among adolescents, including vaccination and correct and consistent wearing of masks.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/23/health/how-many-teens-vaccinated-covid-19-back-to-school-cnn-analysis/index.html',1,60),(46,'Why contact tracing was a missed opportunity to save lives in the US','It was supposed to have both prevented the worst ravages of the pandemic and given people in lockdown something to do.An army of contact tracers working the phones would find people exposed to the virus, warning them of the risks, giving them solid advice on how to quarantine and watch for symptoms, and prevent the further spread of disease., It\'s the most basic of public health tools -- a way to stop a disease before it can spread too far. Contact tracing stopped the first SARS, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome that ended in 2004 after about 8,000 people had been infected around the world. Only 800 died., Contact tracing, along with vaccination, eradicated smallpox from the planet., It\'s a simple idea: Find people who are infected, isolate them and find everyone they could have passed the disease to, and quarantine them before they can become contagious and infect anyone else., When the novel coronavirus started to spread at the beginning of 2020, public health experts knew it was their best chance at stopping a pandemic. In South Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan and New Zealand, expert teams tracked almost every infection and helped people isolate and quarantine to interrupt the spread., But it never happened in the US -- at least not at a national level. The US has more than 34 million diagnosed cases and 609,000 deaths from Covid-19, more than any other country in the world, even far more-populous India., And that\'s certainly an undercount, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as outside researchers who are trying to keep tabs on cases, such as the University of Washington. Because of a lack of testing and tracking, it\'s likely twice as many or more people have been infected with Covid-19, the CDC says., Missed opportunity to save lives, \"We should have started earlier. We could have saved tons of lives,\" said Dr. Joia Mukherjee, a professor of medicine in the Division of Global Health Equity at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital, and an associate professor of global health and social medicine at Harvard Medical School., \"Contact tracing has saved people. It has saved families,\" added Mukherjee, who is working with global nonprofit Partners in Health, which helped with a few contact tracing programs that did get off the ground in the US., The rare success stories give a tantalizing look at what might have been. San Francisco started a contact tracing program early in the pandemic, a collaboration between the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the University of California San Francisco., By last November, the team reported, these contact tracers had reached more than 80% of people infected and found their close contacts within a week., According to Dr. George Rutherford, an epidemiologist at UCSF who helped advise on the program, if the US had the same per capita Covid-19 mortality rate that San Francisco has seen, 200,000 fewer people would have died., \"This is really something that needs to be in place all over the place,\" Rutherford told CNN., And now, with the US struggling to get 40% more of the population vaccinated, it\'s a missed opportunity to reach people., \"You could redouble your efforts to get vaccinations to people,\" said Mukherjee., Partners in Health has programs in Massachusetts, Newark and in Immokalee, Florida -- where the nonprofit worked with other nonprofits and churches to not only do contact tracing among the impoverished farm workers of the area, but to get them the help they needed to weather the pandemic and the enforced time away from work for illness, isolation and quarantine., \"Then you can look at a city like Newark, New Jersey, where the infection rate was much more rampant among homeless individuals,\" she said. There, the mayor helped organize hotel rooms so people who couldn\'t easily quarantine had somewhere to stay away from people they might infect., Former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden, now CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, was an early advocate for using contact tracing to control the pandemic. It\'s not too late, he says., \"It is possible to stop spread,\" Frieden told CNN. \"It is possible to use contact tracing to promote vaccination in the pockets of the population that are having cases.\", Tackling doubt and mistrust, People who don\'t believe the virus is a real threat change their minds when the infection hits their community, their neighbors, their families, said Mukherjee. Contact tracing is a tool to help persuade them when they are the most likely to be receptive to getting a vaccine., It\'s also the best way to keep track of the epidemic. The lack of contact tracing is a lost opportunity to understand how the virus spreads, whether new variants are really more transmissible and, if so, how much more transmissible, and to watch in real time to see just how effective vaccinations really are., \"If you look at the countries that are doing the best around the world, they have really good information about what\'s happening,\" Frieden said., \"Because of the Delta variant, contact tracing is important, and it could help reduce the impact of that variant on our communities if we\'re applying it rigorously and trying to find as many cases as possible,\" said Crystal Watson, a senior associate at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and an environmental health specialist at Hopkins\' Bloomberg School of Public Health., \"If you could do really great contact tracing on breakthrough cases, and keep it up over time, you could understand the long-term consequences of having breakthrough infections in someone who was vaccinated,\" said David Holtgrave, dean of the School of Public Health at the University at Albany, State University of New York. \"That could provide a lot of crucial information.\", The US federal government erred in never really kickstarting contact tracing nationally, Watson said., \"I think we could have avoided a lot of illness and deaths if had we really leaned into this in the April, May time frame of last year but it clearly wasn\'t a top priority, like testing was at that time,\" Watson told CNN., A neglected public health infrastructure, Plus, states, cities and counties had little to work with., \"We started from a place of very depleted public health workforce. There were not enough people working in public health to really tackle this problem, so it was a big ask to start with,\" Watson said., \"We also had, particularly at the state level, some governors just not wanting to put a lot of resources into to doing contact tracing,\" she added., A lack of trust also killed many efforts to use technology as a contact tracing aid. Apple, Google and other companies have provided apps people can install to tell them if they\'ve been near someone who was later diagnosed., \"The technology has not been widely adopted, though some states are faring better than others. A lack of public trust in new technology -- coupled with a lack of resources in the public health agencies peddling that technology -- hampered both adoption rates and how people used the systems,\" said Dr. Peter Kilmarx, Deputy Director of the Fogarty International Center at the National Institutes of Health, who has been keeping an eye on contact tracing efforts., And politics got in the way., \"There was a lot of politicization of contact tracing, which made it so that people in some places were very skeptical of it and didn\'t want to participate,\" Watson said., To many people, the idea of telling a stranger who you might have been in contact with smacked of informing against friends and collaborating with Big Brother., \"To tell someone who is trying to work two jobs and living in a group home that they need to quarantine without offering the kind of social support they need is not going to be very effective,\" Kilmarx said., Frieden echoed this., \"We kind of poisoned the well with how contact tracing was approached. It should be a service. It should be a way of helping people get the services they need,\" he said., \"It is very, very important that we rebrand contact tracing. It really should be a Covid support service.\", People are usually going to choose their jobs over protecting themselves or their community from the uncertain risk of infection, so they have to see they will benefit from cooperating with public health officials., San Francisco had a head start on this with decades of using contact tracing as a support service for people at high risk of HIV/AIDS, said Rutherford. So people had trust in the outreach efforts., \"We\'ve had pretty good compliance with it all,\" Rutherford said. \"They certainly got all the older elderly homeless off the streets, put them up in hotels. And we also did offer hotel rooms for people who had to isolate,\" he added., \"So if you have got four guys from someplace in Latin America, construction workers sharing an apartment in the Mission District of San Francisco, you can\'t just say, \'Oh, yeah, you\'re going to isolate in that bed and we\'ll put a sheet around you,\' \" he added., The city recruited librarians idled by shutdowns, graduate students and even tax assessors who were being kept home. UCSF trained them, teaching the skills needed to get sensitive details from people who may be confused and wary., Tackling inequality, Contact tracing is one of the best tools to help even out the inequities the pandemic has blown wide open, Mukherjee said., \"A lot of people had the luxury of working from home or a large enough house that they didn\'t have to share a bathroom,\" she said. For wealthier Americans, isolating or quarantining was an inconvenience at worst., \"But for other people, those things were not so easy,\" Mukherjee said. \"Many of our frontline workers live in congregate setting or really small houses.\", The successful programs Partners in Health supported helped provide food delivery, diaper services and help in navigating laws preventing eviction., \"We believe contact tracing is very important to try to control and understand where things are spreading, but that the provision of social support is another important aspect, so that you\'re not just giving people information, but you\'re helping them to take action,\" Mukherjee said., The US may have missed a second chance at comprehensive contact tracing this spring, when cases dropped, Holtgrave said., \"Early on, at the very beginning, there was a sense that contact tracing was key and we should use it. Then the number of cases got so overwhelming that it was almost impossible to keep up. This past spring, cases were down to a level where maybe contact tracing was more feasible. But now we rapidly see it going up,\" he said., Watson sees the same problem. \"If we have big outbreaks, I am not sure that contact tracing will be able to keep up,\" she said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/23/health/covid-contact-tracing-missed-opportunity/index.html',1,61),(47,'Three states are seeing about 40% of the country\'s new Covid-19 cases','While White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters Thursday the country has \"fundamentally changed the course of this pandemic\" and the threat of serious disease and death now is to the unvaccinated. , He said counties with the highest case rates have significantly lower vaccination rates than other areas. And a few states have seen many of the new cases., \"This week, just three states Florida, Texas and Missouri, three states with lower vaccination rates accounted for 40 percent of all cases nationwide,\" Zients said at a White House news conference. \"For the second week in a row, one in five of all cases occurring in Florida alone.

Greg Abbott recently said he will not be implementing another mask mandate. He told CNN affiliate KPRC he believes enough immunity has been acquired through vaccines or exposure and it would be inappropriate to force people who are already immune to wear a mask. , According to CDC data, 43.1% of the Texas population is fully vaccinated. The CDC advises people should get vaccinated regardless of whether they\'ve had Covid-19 and many doctors believe the immunity you get from vaccination is likely stronger than the immunity you get from previous infection., Young people intubated with Covid-19 should be \'a gigantic wakeup call,\' Alabama doctor says, With Covid-19 cases rising and vaccination rates on the decline, health experts say they are concerned about the next chapter in the pandemic -- especially for younger Americans, who they say are feeling the impacts., \"We do know that in our ICUs, we are seeing younger people intubated who are very sick or who are on the floors and are very sick,\" said Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \"That should be a gigantic wake-up call.\", With one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, Marrazzo said, Alabama is \"at the beginning of a wildfire\" when it comes to Covid-19 spread. And like many other health professionals in states with low vaccination rates, she said she desperately hopes stories and data showing the impact of the virus will motivate younger people to get vaccinated., Ensemble forecasts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published Wednesday project Covid-19 deaths and hospitalizations will likely increase over the next four weeks. , Meanwhile, vaccinations rates, which health experts have emphasized as a key part of the plan to get the virus under control, are down to the lowest they have been since January, with 516,441 doses on average reported administered each day of the past week, according to the CDC., Nationally 48.8% of people are fully vaccinated, but some states, such as Alabama with 33.9% and Arkansas with 35.5%, are particularly struggling to get a high enough vaccination rate to slow or stop the spread of the virus, according to the CDC. , That is especially heartbreaking, two doctors say, when patients decide they want the vaccine too late. , \"What I really wish you could see, is to look into the eyes of a young father or a gentleman who knows that they may be short for this world because they didn\'t get their vaccine, and the regret and remorse on their face -- and fear,\" Dr. Michael Bolding at Arkansas\' Washington Regional Medical Center said in a video he made to beg Arkansas residents to get vaccinated. , A doctor in Alabama said one of the last things her patients do before they are intubated due to Covid-19, is beg her for the vaccine, but she has to tell them it\'s too late., When those patients die and she talks to their family, they tell her they thought the virus was a hoax, Dr. Brytney Cobia of Grandview Medical Center said in a Facebook post. She said she tells them the best way to honor their loved one is to get vaccinated., \"I go back to my office, write their death note, and say a small prayer that this loss will save more lives,\" Cobia wrote, urging people to ask her questions about the vaccine. \"It\'s not too late, but some day it might be.\", Covid-19 has unvaccinated people \'in its sights,\' expert says, Although health officials are worried about the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant, experts such as National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said those who are vaccinated are still well protected., The Delta variant is \"one of the most infectious respiratory viruses we know of, and I have seen in my 20-year career,\" Walensky said Thursday., \"The good news is that current scientific evidence shows that our current vaccines are working as they did in clinical trials, even against the Delta variant,\" Walensky said at a White House COVID-19 Response Team briefing., The same is not true, Collins said, for unvaccinated Americans., \"For those who are not vaccinated, this is becoming a pandemic that has you in its sights,\" Collins told CNN\'s Jim Acosta on Wednesday., \"We are in for trouble, as CDC\'s projections have laid out, in the coming weeks, especially in those parts of the country where vaccination rates are low and Delta is widespread,\" Collins said., Los Angeles County reported 2,551 new coronavirus cases Wednesday, a 20-fold increase in a month, according to the public health department. Just one month ago, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health reported 124 new cases., The spread of Covid-19 not only has consequences for those that it directly infects, but it also increases the risk for new variants to form, said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the US Food and Drug Administration vaccine advisory committee., \"The virus will continue to reproduce itself, continue to cause suffering and hospitalization, and worse still, continue to have the chance to make variants that are much more resistant to vaccine-induced immunity,\" Offit said. , Even people who have been infected with the virus should be vaccinated, Walensky said. , \"If you\'ve already had Covid infection, CDC guidance strongly recommends that you get vaccinated,\" Walensky said., \"It gives you longer lasting and more robust protection with the breadth and depth of coverage needed to conquer the variants currently circulating in this country.\", Vaccines are the strongest tool, but mask policies may help, The risk coming from increased spread and not enough vaccination has pushed some leaders to advocate for a return to mask policies., Former US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said in an opinion piece published in the Washington Post that the CDC \"urgently needs to revise its guidance on masking to combat the rapid growth in covid-19 infections driven by the delta variant.\", Vaccinations are the strongest tool to fight the virus, he said, but rates are still too low and \"with many communities -- particularly communities of color -- at risk for yet another devastating wave of cases, hospitalizations and deaths, masks are the next best tool that officials have in places where vaccination levels remain low despite covid cases rapidly rising.\", A study published Wednesday in JAMA Network Open found that protective measures -- like masks, handwashing and physical distance -- help protect against the spread. , Among more than 500 essential workers who continued to work at Colorado State University in Fort Collins through the first six months of the pandemic, not one tested positive for Covid-19 in the months that were studied., In places such as New Orleans, leaders have returned to advising residents to wear masks indoors when they\'re with people outside of their immediate household.

However, the FDA has yet to disclose a timeline for when its work will be complete and data is still being reviewed., On Wednesday, President Joe Biden told CNN\'s Don Lemon during a CNN Townhall that he expects Covid-19 vaccines could get full approval \"quickly.\", \"They\'re not promising me any specific date, but my expectation, talking to the group of scientists we put together... plus others in the field, is that sometime, maybe in the beginning of the school year, at the end of August, beginning September, October, they\'ll get a final approval,\" Biden said., Earlier Wednesday, the National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told CNN\'s Jim Acosta that full approval could come in the \"next couple of months.\", Pfizer\'s timeline, Vaccine maker Pfizer appears to be furthest along in the process. , In July, the company announced that the FDA granted its vaccine a priority review, so that sets the regulatory clock for six months, meaning technically the company should know if it has approval by January. A standard review is 10 months. , The acting commissioner of the FDA, Dr. Janet Woodcock, has said the FDA intends to complete the review in advance of its January deadline., \"So, we all know that\'s not going to take that long,\" said Melissa Tice, program director of regulatory affairs and assistant professor of clinical research and leadership at George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences. , Because the FDA has already reviewed the manufacturing materials and has been reviewing clinical data all along, Tice said, \"We don\'t expect it to go the full six-month priority review clock.\", Tice says she thinks full approval for Pfizer\'s vaccine could come in September. Some experts like Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center think it may be as early as August. , Moderna\'s timeline, For vaccine maker Moderna, the company told CNN Wednesday that is does not have a specific time frame for approval. It is still working with the FDA on what\'s called a rolling submission for approval -- it shares new data with the agency as it is generated., \"We are still in the process of completing our rolling submission, which we announced on June 1st. It is not complete at this time,\" Ray Jordan, a spokesperson for Moderna said. \"It\'s not the case that the FDA has our final submission and that we are waiting to hear from them.\", Moderna expects it may have its materials complete this fall. The time frame for approval would then be subject to the FDA regulatory review process, Moderna said., Where the process is now, Historically, getting a vaccine licensed by the fall would be fast, especially with as much as the FDA has to review. , At this point, what takes time is that the agency has to go through absolutely everything, it cannot skip a page, and there is a lot of everything., \"When we were reviewing applications back when they were on paper, there was so much, it would not fit on the freight elevator. That\'s how big the application is, you have lots of data to review,\" said Norman Baylor, who had run the FDA\'s Office of Vaccines Research and Review and been through this process several times. He\'s the current CEO of Biologics Consulting., The Covid-19 vaccines received authorization based on interim data that showed the vaccines were safe and effective for only about three months. \"Although, when something\'s 95% effective, you can assume it\'s probably going to be highly effective for awhile,\" said Offit., For full approval, the FDA has at least six months of efficacy data to review. \"People are saying \'why is it taking so long?\' Well, the FDA wants to make sure that it has a protective duration, long term effect,\" Tice said. \"It\'s not that the agency, I think, has any concerns about the vaccine per se, they just per licensure requirements, you have to have this additional data.\", \"The FDA does not cut corners on making sure of the quality, the purity, the potency of your products.\", Offit believes the data review should go pretty quickly, since the FDA has been getting data all along. What often takes time is that the FDA has to also validate the process that makes the vaccine for it to be licensed. Every step has to be validated. , \"Whether it\'s the computers that are being used or cleaning out the vats, or whatever it is, it\'s a lot of boxes to tick to ensure that there\'s consistency in each lot to the next,\" Offit said.  , That means an interdisciplinary team of FDA experts is pouring through millions of documents, running their own analysis, getting any clarification that it needs from the vaccine companies, and giving the manufacturing process a thorough inspection. , And it\'s not just one FDA person that does the review, Baylor said. There\'s a secondary and tertiary review. So a clinician would review the material and then a supervisor would need to review it and then it goes up to the division director., \"We have some reviewers who are reviewing long into the night, really, this is not a 9 to 5 review,\" Baylor said. \"The public is not aware, but yes people are giving up their vacations, working on weekends, Saturdays and Sundays. You\'re working into the night.\", \"The FDA is not sitting down twiddling their thumbs,\" Baylor said. , Calls to move faster, While historically, the process has moved quickly, for some it\'s not fast enough. , Dr. Eric Topol wrote an editorial for the \"New York Times\" earlier this month that argued that the millions of people who have gotten these mRNA vaccines demonstrate these vaccines work. \"This is the most studied biologic in the history of mankind for safety and efficacy,\" Topol told CNN., \"I have been frustrated because I know it should have been approved by now,\" Topol said. \"Janet Woodcock made a statement that this was \'among the highest priorities.\' No, it has to be the number one priority.\", In response to Topol\'s editorial, the FDA\'s current Director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Peter Marks argued that \"any vaccine approval without completion of the high-quality review and evaluation that Americans expect the agency to perform would undermine the FDA\'s statutory responsibilities, affect trust in the agency and do little to help combat vaccine hesitancy.\", Why full approval matters, Yet, as vaccination rates have dropped dramatically in the US, some have pointed to approval as one sure way to speed up the process. , A Kaiser Family Foundation survey of US adults released this week found that among the one-third of adults surveyed who are not yet vaccinated, 16% said the vaccine was too new, too unknown or not tested enough. Some said in this poll that they wouldn\'t get a vaccine until it is required. While companies are allowed to require the vaccine, experts believe more will make it a requirement if -- and when -- it gets full approval., \"If it was approved with the full approval from FDA -- which we all anticipate may be coming pretty soon...Maybe in the next couple of months -- then the legal ability to mandate becomes a lot stronger,\" Collins, the NIH director, said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/22/health/covid-19-vaccine-approval-when/index.html',1,64),(49,'Johnson &amp; Johnson coronavirus vaccine\'s benefits still outweigh risks, CDC data show','The benefits of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Janssen coronavirus vaccine still outweigh potential risks, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., \"Many hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths can be prevented through Janssen and mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, far outweighing the risks,\" CDC researcher Dr. Hannah Rosenblum told the agency\'s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in a meeting on Thursday. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are messenger RNA or mRNA vaccines., Earlier this month, the US Food and Drug Administration updated the label on Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s coronavirus vaccine to warn of the possible increased risk of a rare neurological complication known as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)., The FDA said 100 preliminary reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome had been filed with the US government\'s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, out of 12.8 million Janssen vaccines given. While the FDA said it had not established the vaccine could cause the syndrome, it noted an increase in reports of the sometimes paralyzing condition., In Thursday\'s meeting, Rosenblum presented data illustrating how many Covid-19 cases could be prevented by every million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s vaccine administered, compared with how many complications of Guillain-Barré syndrome might emerge.,  , The CDC data show that for women ages 18 to 29, the vaccine would prevent 8,900 cases of Covid-19 and five Covid-19 deaths and only one GBS case might occur. For men in that age group, 6,600 Covid-19 cases and three Covid-19 deaths would be prevented and only two GBS cases might occur., For every million doses administered among women ages 30 to 49, the data suggest 10,100 Covid-19 cases and 20 Covid-19 deaths could be prevented compared with the risk of about six to seven GBS cases. For men in that age group, 7,600 Covid-19 cases and 25 Covid-19 deaths could be prevented compared with the risk of about seven to eight GBS cases, according to the CDC data., For every million doses administered among women ages 50 to 64, the data suggest 12,100 Covid-19 cases and 120 Covid-19 deaths could be prevented compared with the risk of seven to eight GBS cases. Among men, the vaccine would prevent about 10,100 Covid-19 cases and 140 Covid-19 deaths and come with the risk of between 14 to 17 GBS cases, according to the CDC data., \"In 65 and older, benefits are even greater,\" Rosenblum said., , Among women ages 65 and older, for every million doses administered, some 29,000 Covid-19 cases and 840 Covid-19 deaths would be prevented compared with the risk of about eight to 10 GBS cases. For men in that age group, about 36,600 Covid-19 cases and 2,300 Covid-19 deaths would be prevented and seven to eight GBS cases might occur., \"The risk of developing Guillain-Barre after Covid is much higher than the risk of any of the risks presented here,\" Dr. Joanne Waldstreicher, Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s chief medical officer, said in the meeting., With about 100 cases of GBS out of more than 12 million people in the US who received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine as of June 30, that gives \"an overall reporting rate of 8 cases per million people vaccinated,\" Waldstreicher said. \"This is in the context of the different published rates of GBS in the US, which have ranged from 1 to 5 cases per million people.\", \'Those risks have got to be stated\', Some ACIP members said on Thursday they are still concerned about the potential risk of GBS, a neurological disorder in which the body\'s immune system may damage nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis., , \"I definitely agree that the overall benefits of Covid-19 vaccines far outweigh the risks,\" ACIP member Dr. Pablo Sanchez, a pediatrician at Ohio State University -- Nationwide Children\'s Hospital, said. \"However, I am concerned about the Janssen product,\" Sanchez said, calling the risks not benign and, although rare, are \"quite significant.\", \"I have no problem continuing to have the Janssen product available, but I think that those risks have got to be stated upfront to the person who\'s receiving that vaccine,\" Sanchez said. \"And personally, if it were my choice, at this time from what I know, I would recommend the messenger RNA vaccines over the Janssen product.\", ACIP member Dr. Sarah Long, a pediatrician at Drexel University, said that risks tied to Pfizer and Moderna vaccines should also be part of conversations., Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna\'s vaccines use messenger RNA or mRNA to deliver the vaccine, while J&amp;J\'s uses an inactivated common cold virus called an adenovirus., In June, the US Food and Drug Administration added a warning about the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis to fact sheets for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines., The warning notes that reports of adverse events following vaccination -- particularly after the second dose -- suggest increased risks of both types of heart inflammation. , The one and done, Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s coronavirus vaccine is administered as a one-dose shot, whereas the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are administered as two doses, given 21 and 28 days apart, respectively., \"Having a single-dose product available is important,\" said ACIP member Dr. Henry Bernstein, a pediatrician at Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northell., Bernstein also agreed that the benefits outweigh the risks., , \"There are a lot of people who really just want the one -- the single-dose vaccine,\" said ACIP member Dr. Sharon Frey, who is a vaccine specialist at St Louis University Medical School. , \"The risk-benefit leans towards benefit of receiving these vaccines in so many ways,\" Frey added. \"If I was going to be the recipient of these vaccines, knowing what data that is out there, that I would like to have that data provided to me as a receiver of vaccine, and I think that\'s what we need to be able to accomplish, is making that data available to people so they can choose what\'s best for them.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/22/health/johnson--johnson-coronavirus-vaccine-risks-cdc/index.html',1,65),(50,'Hospitalized Covid-19 patients are asking for the vaccine -- when it\'s too late, two health care workers say','As the \"When they come into the (hospital) system, they say, \'Can I get vaccinated?\' And at that point, you can\'t,\" Alix Zacharski, an  intensive care clinical nurse manager at Miami\'s Jackson Health System, told CNN\'s \"Newsroom\" Thursday., \"We have to let the virus run its course, and then hopefully\" the vaccine can be given, she said., Not all of these patients live to get the chance, an Alabama doctor says., Dr. Brytney Cobia of Grandview Medical Center wrote this about young people recently arriving at her hospital seriously ill with Covid-19:, \"One of the last things they do before they\'re intubated is beg me for the vaccine.

More than 27,700 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals on Monday -- nearly double the number from June 27, when a 2021 low of 15,982 was counted, the US Department of Health and Human Services says., These rises have come as the proportion of Delta variant cases has increased. , The Delta variant represented an estimated 83.2% of all coronavirus cases in the US for the two weeks ending last Saturday, the CDC says. That\'s up from an estimated 31.9% for the two weeks ending June 19, according to the CDC., Vaccines available in the United States are proving to be effective against the Delta variant. Although breakthrough cases happen, people who are fully vaccinated rarely become very sick. , But only 48.8% of the total US population is fully vaccinated against the virus, according to the CDC -- well below the 70% to 85% that health experts have estimated it would take to slow or stop the spread. , Zacharski urged eligible unvaccinated people to get inoculated., \"We really want to make sure everybody understands: We need your help, to help you,\" Zacharski said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/22/health/hospitalized-patients-covid-19-vaccine/index.html',1,66),(51,'The pandemic has pushed children\'s mental health and access to care to a \'crisis point\'','Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, Bailey Lynn and her friends often talked about the toll the virus has taken. Still, the high school senior was surprised recently by the results of a survey she created to assess her classmates\' mental health during the pandemic: Only a quarter who said they thought they needed a therapist had access to one.\"I didn\'t know it was so bad,\" said Lynn, a member of the Children\'s Hospital Colorado Youth Action Board. \"And I know the situation isn\'t much better at other schools.\", Many adults report that the pandemic has been hard on their mental health. For kids, some experts say, it has become a crisis., Children\'s hospitals around the country say they have seen a meteoric rise in the number of children who need mental health help. Access to care, which was a problem before the pandemic, particularly for kids of color, has gotten much worse., Several children\'s hospitals said the supply of inpatient psychiatric beds has been so short, they\'ve had to board kids in their emergency departments -- sometimes for weeks., \"We really have never seen anything like this rapid growth in kids presenting with mental health problems and the severity of those problems. I\'ve never seen this in my entire career,\" said Jenna Glover, the director of psychology training at Children\'s Hospital Colorado., It got so bad, Children\'s Hospital Colorado declared a \"state of emergency\" in May. Glover said the number of kids they treated for anxiety doubled -- and depression numbers tripled -- compared to pre-pandemic levels. Substance and eating disorders increased, too., In January through April of this year, behavioral health emergency department visits were up 72% over the same time period two years ago, the hospital said. The numbers have been tapering off this month and last, but there is concern there will be another spike when school starts back in August and September., Other hospitals saw even bigger increases. In January, Wolfson Children\'s Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida, for example, said it saw a 300% increase in the number of behavioral health emergency admissions since April 2020., \"Kids\' mental health, truly, has been under assault for over a year,\" Glover said. \"It\'s probably actually worse than people think it is.\", Nationally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found emergency department visits for suspected suicide attempts during February and March of 2021 were more than 50% higher for teen girls, compared to 2019. It was up more than 4% for boys. From April to October 2020, hospitals around the country saw a 31% increase in 12- to 17-year-old kids seeking help for their mental health, and a 24% increase for kids ages 5 to 11., In March of this year, Seattle Children\'s reported seeing one or two patients every night for attempted suicide. With so few inpatient psychiatric beds in the area, the hospital had to board kids in the emergency department. Some waited two weeks before a bed became available., With so few pediatric psychiatric beds available In Massachusetts, 39% of pediatric patient who came to the ER for a mental health issue in 2020 wound up staying there, according to a state report., During the pandemic, Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children\'s Hospital of Chicago has reached what Dr. Jennifer Hoffmann called a \"crisis point.\" There were so many mental health-related emergency room visits that it activated a response usually reserved for disaster management. \"It allows for coordination at the highest level of leadership in order to address the mental health crisis among children,\" said Hoffmann, an attending physician in emergency medicine., Hoffmann\'s hospital also had to board kids in the emergency department or admitted them to medical beds, where they sometimes wait for days until a psychiatric inpatient bed opened up. Colleague Dr. John Walkup, chair of the Pritzker Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health at the hospital, said the pandemic exacerbated access problems that have been around for awhile., \"We\'ve never had an adequate mental health system in the United States for kids -- never -- and so you take an inadequate system to begin with, and then all of a sudden, you put kids who are at elevated risk ... in a very difficult living and life situation. And you now have a crisis of access,\" Walkup said., Many of the kids his hospital treats in the emergency department had a mental health problem that was never diagnosed, or was inadequately treated before the pandemic. Now, when they seek help, they can\'t get a regular appointment with a therapist. Even before the pandemic, studies have shown it can sometimes take months to get a first appointment., \"Those kids, when you take away school, family support, income support, food support, housing support, or they lose a relative, those kids really become symptomatic in a big way,\" Walkup said., Children who can get treatment, Walkup says, are doing OK during the pandemic. It\'s the ones who can\'t access help that the world should worry about., \"The world doesn\'t work if we don\'t have good behavioral health for kids,\" Walkup said., In Colorado, the mismatch of supply and demand for additional inpatient psychiatric beds is unmatched in pre-pandemic times, said Zach Zaslow, the senior director of government affairs at Children\'s Hospital Colorado., \"We end up boarding kids in our emergency department or in our inpatient unit, not because that\'s what\'s best for them but because there\'s literally nowhere else for them to go,\" Zaslow said. \"Sometimes they get transferred to out-of-state residential facilities to get the care that they need, which splits families up,\" he said. \"And that can be traumatizing for kids as well.\", If there is a silver lining in the pandemic, the experts say, people have started to recognize that the system has to change., \"The pandemic has become the great equalizer and there seems to be a wider recognition that this is something we have to address more broadly,\" said Colleen Cicchetti, a pediatric psychologist with Lurie Children\'s Hospital., Zaslow said after Children\'s Hospital in Colorado declared a state of emergency, there was bipartisan recognition about issues of access. The state set aside about $500 million of the money Colorado got from the federal American Recovery Act plan for behavioral health for adults and kids. Colorado also increased its funding for residential treatment facilities., And if kids are able to get support, there are highly effective treatments., Bailey Lynn knows exactly how important it can be. In addition to being on the youth board for Children\'s Hospital Colorado, the hospital has helped her with her own mental health long before the pandemic. She was bullied for much of her life, and in seventh grade, she felt so isolated that she couldn\'t see a way through., \"That of course led to my first suicide attempt and I\'ve had a few more throughout the years,\" Lynn said., Therapy, and being able to advocate for help, kept her alive. But the pandemic has not left her unscathed., \"I just remember days that I would just turn off my computer when school was over and I would just lay in my bed and I wouldn\'t have the motivation to do anything, and then I would simultaneously be anxious from not doing anything,\" Lynn said., Lynn said it helps to know she\'s not alone., Talking with her peers on the board she learned \"everyone was just burnt out\" from the pandemic. Together, they are now \"just counting down the days until this quarantine and Covid is over.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/22/health/covid-19-pandemic-mental-health-children/index.html',1,67),(52,'How worried should vaccinated people be about Covid-19 breakthrough infections?','Coronavirus infections are on the rise again in the United States. While more than 99% of deaths are among those unvaccinated, anecdotal reports abound of breakthrough infections, or cases of fully vaccinated people who still test positive for Covid-19 — including several How worried should vaccinated people be of contracting Covid-19? If you\'re vaccinated, are you still able to transmit coronavirus to others, such as young children too young to get the vaccine themselves? Does the more transmissible Delta variant change the equation, and what precautions should vaccinated people still be taking?, To give us some guidance during these uncertain times, we turned to CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She\'s also author of a new book out next week, \"Lifelines: A Doctor\'s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.\", CNN: Can vaccinated people become infected with Covid-19?, Dr. Leana Wen: Yes, they can. Here\'s what the Covid-19 vaccines do. First, and most importantly, they protect you very well against severe disease. That\'s key. This is a disease that has taken the lives of over 600,000 Americans and millions of people around the world. If you get the vaccine, you know that you are very unlikely to become severely ill to the point of needing to be hospitalized or to succumb to the disease. According to federal health officials, 99.5% of deaths from Covid-19 are now among the unvaccinated. That is a real testament to the power of the vaccines., The vaccines also protect against becoming ill from Covid-19, but this protection is not 100%. With the Delta variant, the vaccines may be even less effective against mild disease — though still effective against severe disease., That means breakthrough infections — or infections in people who are fully vaccinated — can and do happen. , CNN: Does it matter if you\'re in a community with a lot of infection? Are you more likely to get a breakthrough infection?, Wen: Yes, and that\'s why it matters what\'s going on around you even if you are fully vaccinated. Risk is additive. The vaccine protects you well, but if you are constantly exposed to people who are carrying coronavirus, at some point you could have a breakthrough infection., I\'ve used the analogy before of a raincoat. The vaccine is an excellent raincoat. If you\'re in the occasional drizzle, you\'ll probably be fine. But if you\'re going from thunderstorm to thunderstorm, at some point, you could get wet., This is also why we have to see vaccination as not just an individual choice. Even if you\'re vaccinated yourself, it matters if others around you are vaccinated, too., CNN: Do we know how common breakthrough infections are or whether people who are vaccinated but get infected are able to transmit to others?, Wen: These are really important questions, and unfortunately, we don\'t know the answers. In May, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided to stop tracking mild breakthrough infections. They are only reporting cases of breakthrough infections severe enough to result in hospitalization and death. Many of us in public health have argued that we need to know the data around mild breakthrough infections, too. It\'s important to know how often these are occurring and among whom. For example, are they more common in older individuals and those with compromised immune systems, suggesting that these individuals may need a booster shot sooner? Do they increase in frequency after a certain point following vaccination, and are they more common with one vaccine versus another? Do people with breakthrough infections develop long-haul Covid?, Another key question is whether people with breakthrough infections are able to transmit Covid-19 and infect others. Earlier studies found that vaccination also substantially reduces the amount of virus someone exposed to Covid-19 would carry. That even if they test positive or develop mild symptoms, they are unlikely to infect others. However, these studies were done before the Delta variant became the dominant form of the virus in the US -- the CDC has reported that 83% of cases in the US are now due to Delta. , Other research finds that the unvaccinated who are infected with the Delta variant carry 1,000 times the amount of virus than people with the original variant. That calls into question what happens if someone is vaccinated but infected with the Delta variant. We just don\'t know, at this point, how likely it is for a vaccinated person with a breakthrough infection due to the Delta variant to be contagious to others., CNN: Do the unknowns around the Delta variant change your recommendations for vaccinated people interacting with others?, Wen: I would use an abundance of caution until we have more data. A vaccinated person around other fully vaccinated people is probably pretty safe and would not need precautions like masking and distancing. On the other hand, a vaccinated person who is exposed constantly to unvaccinated people, in crowded, indoor settings where no one is wearing masks, could become infected themselves. And even if they don\'t have symptoms, there is definitely the possibility that they could carry the virus and infect others., Until we know more about whether those vaccinated but contract the Delta variant could transmit it to others, I would urge people to be cautious if they live at home with unvaccinated or immunocompromised family members. They should consider wearing masks in indoor spaces like grocery stores and trying to avoid high-risk settings like crowded bars where others around them are unmasked and have unknown vaccination status., CNN: To be clear, you would still recommend the vaccines?, Wen: Absolutely. The most important thing the Covid-19 vaccines do is to protect against hospitalization and death. They have proven to be remarkably effective at this, even with the Delta variant. Breakthrough infections are to be expected, and the more infections occur among the unvaccinated, the more infections there will be among the vaccinated. , The key to stopping the pandemic is for us to reach a high enough level of immunity that the virus has nowhere else to go. We can get there — but all of us have to do our part and get vaccinated. Vaccination protects the individual, and it protects others around us, too.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/22/health/breakthrough-covid-infections-wellness/index.html',1,68),(53,'Child cases of Covid-19 are rising as schools gear up to reopen.

Child age ranges vary by state, according to the group\'s most recent report, with more than half of states defining children as anyone 19 or younger, and two states -- Utah and Florida -- limiting the range to anyone 14 or younger., The AAP said severe illness remains rare among children, but with Covid-19 cases rising in most of the country once again, experts have warned lagging vaccinations and the ferocious Delta variant could spell trouble for the country\'s youngest, many of whom are still ineligible for a vaccine., \"So many people, unvaccinated individuals, are getting Delta that children are getting swept up along with it, and I think this is going to make things very difficult as the school year opens,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, said Tuesday., The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday also stressed the need to take the virus -- and its threat to children -- seriously., \"I think we fall into this flawed thinking of saying that only 400 of these 600,000 deaths from Covid-19 have been in children,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing. \"Children are not supposed to die. And so, 400 is a huge amount for respiratory season.\", No Covid-19 vaccine has yet been given the green light for Americans younger than 12. And while pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna are conducting clinical trials, it will likely be months until younger children are able to get a shot. , , Vaccine data for youngest likely still months away, It\'s \"very likely\" data for Covid-19 vaccines in children younger than 12 may be available by late fall or early winter, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in the Tuesday Senate committee hearing., \"But doesn\'t mean that then it\'s all of a sudden going to be allowed to happen,\" he said. \"That will be a regulatory decision that the FDA will have to make.\", Late last week, Fauci told CNN\'s Jim Acosta he believed a decision from the US Food and Drug Administration \"likely will not happen until we get well into the winter, towards the end of this year.\", Pfizer\'s data on 5-to-11-year-olds from its vaccine study could come some time in September, and depending on the findings, the company previously told CNN it could ask the FDA for an emergency use authorization that same month. , Data for 2-to-5-year-olds could come soon after, while for babies and toddlers -- 6 months to 2 years -- Pfizer said it could potentially get data in October or November and ask the FDA to authorize emergency use shortly after that. , Moderna previously declined to provide a timeline to CNN on when it may have trial data results for its child vaccine study. , , Many eligible children still not vaccinated, With a significant number of students still not yet allowed to get a vaccine, the AAP released new guidance Monday recommending universal masking in schools for everyone 2 and older, regardless of vaccination status., The group\'s position is stricter than guidance from the CDC, which recommended earlier this month masks should be worn inside by anyone 2 and older who is not fully vaccinated. , But health experts agree the more children who are vaccinated, the safer the return to school will be. , \"I think it\'s critically important that our schools be open for full in-person learning in the fall,\" Walensky said at Tuesday\'s hearing. And the \"most important thing\" Americans can do to help, she said, is get vaccinated., \"The best thing would be to have everybody vaccinated who can be vaccinated,\" she added. \"Surround unvaccinated children who are not yet eligible with people who are vaccinated to protect them.\", Of roughly 25 million children 12 to 17 years old in the United States, roughly 8.9 million have begun their Covid-19 vaccinations, according to CDC data. , Having to figure out which children are vaccinated and who should be wearing masks \"puts a lot of burden\" on schools, one expert said, and having mask mandates for everyone -- especially as the Delta variant circulates -- would be easier as students return to school, one expert told CNN on Tuesday. , \"You\'re going to have a lot of children less than 12 years of age who don\'t even have the option of getting a vaccine,\" Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia, said. \"So I think children are at risk. I think if people have children that are 10 years old, 11 years old, they\'re thinking, \'there\'\'s no vaccine, I think my child\'s going to be at risk.\'\", \"If I was the parent of a child that age, I would want all those children to wear masks,\" he added. , One official expects \'significant\' outbreaks in schools, Despite experts\' recommendations, some states have already enacted legislation prohibiting districts from requiring masks in schools -- setting up yet another potential round of clashes between health and local leaders across the country. , Among those states is Arkansas, where Act 977 notes that receiving a Covid-19 vaccine \"shall not be a condition of education.\", The state\'s top health official said Tuesday he expects to see \"significant outbreaks within the school system.\", \"What\'s already telling me that that\'s going to happen are the number of daycare closures that have occurred because of outbreaks occurring, and the camp exposures and closures that are occurring,\" Dr. Jose Romero, secretary of health of the Arkansas Health Department, said in a US News and World Report event on vaccine inequity and misinformation. \"What I\'m trying to do publicly and privately with my own patients is stress the importance of the mask.\" , The state has one major children\'s hospital that has already seen a \"significant number\" of children with Covid-19, Romero said, which, coupled with cases of other respiratory viruses, has stretched the facility\'s resources. , \"In three weeks when we start school, this will exacerbate, and that\'s what I\'m very, very concerned about,\" Romero said., ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/20/health/covid-children-cases-schools-reopening/index.html',1,69),(54,'More than 91 million live in US counties with high Covid-19 infections.

The country averaged 37,055 new cases a day across a week as of Tuesday -- 54% higher than the prior week and more than two and a half times the average recorded about two weeks ago (13,665), according to data from Johns Hopkins University. , On Monday, US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra signed a renewal of the public health emergency status due to Covid-19 for another 90 days, as some states are seeing particularly worrying impacts of the pandemic. , The current rise of cases may continue to put pressure on the health care system in Mississippi, state officials warned. , \"We are going to have a rough few weeks, Delta is hitting us very strongly,\" State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said Tuesday. \"We\'re gonna watch people needlessly die over the next month or two, for no good reason.\", , Full vaccine approval will give mandates better legal standing, expert says, Once Covid-19 vaccines receive full approval, it will be easier to mandate vaccination in the US, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said Wednesday., \"If it was approved with the full approval from FDA -- which we all anticipate may be coming pretty soon, maybe in the next couple of months -- then the legal ability to mandate becomes a lot stronger,\" Collins told CNN\'s Jim Acosta., Collins noted that some universities are already mandating Covid-19 vaccines for students, including the schools his grandchildren will be attending in the fall., \"I\'m personally glad to see that,\" he said. \"It\'s so straightforward here to try to keep us from having outbreaks on college campuses with vaccines that are safe and effective.\", \"What\'s not to be in favor of?\" Collins added., Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently said it is likely that Pfizer\'s Covid-19 vaccine will receive full approval by the end of August., Child cases of Covid-19 nearly double since late June, While the virus spreads among unvaccinated adults, children -- many of whom are not yet eligible to be vaccinated -- are feeling the impacts., \"It doesn\'t look like this virus is selectively targeting children,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, professor and dean of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN. \"It\'s just that so many unvaccinated individuals are getting Delta that children are getting swept up along with it.\", Last week, more than 23,000 kids caught Covid-19, which is nearly double what was reported at the end of June, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported Tuesday. Children represent nearly 16% of weekly reported cases., , And though children are at a lower risk to develop serious illness from Covid-19 than older adults, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky pushed back on claims that they are not being affected., \"One thing I just want to note with the children is, I think we fall into this flawed thinking of saying that only 400 of these 600,000 deaths from Covid-19 have been in children,\" Walensky said. \"Children are not supposed to die. And so, 400 is a huge amount for respiratory season.\", Currently, only people 12 and older are eligible for vaccinations, though studies are underway that aim to provide protection to younger children., It is \"very likely\" that data about Covid-19 vaccines in children under 12 may be available by early winter, Fauci has said., And when they do become available, Fauci said he would not be surprised if schools considered including Covid-19 vaccines as a required immunization. If this year and next there is a still a problem with coronavirus, \"it very well might be required,\" Fauci said Tuesday on \"CBS This Morning.\" , Workplaces begin to mandate vaccinations, Many experts have suggested local vaccination mandates could be an important strategy for boosting the vaccination rate and bringing the virus under control., Starting August 2, workers at 11 New York City hospitals and clinical workers with the city\'s health department will be required to either get vaccinated or take weekly Covid-19 tests, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday., The 11 hospitals in question belong to the city\'s public Health + Hospitals system. About 60% of H+H staff are vaccinated now, and the new requirement probably will increase that rate, CEO Dr. Mitchell Katz said., Additionally, Banner Health, a nonprofit health service that is the largest private employer in Arizona, is requiring employees to be vaccinated against Covid-19 in order to keep their jobs. , \"With limited exceptions, all team members have until November 1 to be fully vaccinated,\" the company said Tuesday in a news release., Banner Health cited the rise of the Delta variant as a reason for the mandate, along with the need to prepare for the upcoming flu season. Specifics about how employees could request an exemption to the requirement will be released later, the company said., \"We are taking this step to reduce risk for our patients, their families, visitors and each other,\" President and CEO Peter Fine said. \"Safety is an absolute top priority and the Covid vaccine mandate reflects that commitment.\", Banner Health employs about 52,000 people in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nebraska, Nevada and Wyoming, it said., Such measures could become more common when the vaccines get full FDA authorization, experts have said., Despite the vaccination push, a poll published Tuesday by Axios-Ipsos showed a majority of unvaccinated Americans said they are not at all likely to get vaccinated -- regardless of outreach efforts.

There are no plans for the panel to vote on issues included on the agenda.  , ACIP is a panel composed of outside medical experts in the fields of vaccinology, immunology, pediatrics, internal medicine, nursing, virology, public health, infectious diseases and other subspecialties. CDC typically accepts its recommendations once votes have been cast. , ACIP has provided crucial guidance throughout the pandemic including advice on emergency use authorization for the three Covid-19 vaccines currently available in the US, authorization of Pfizer\'s vaccine for 12-15 year-olds and, in April, to end the pause of the J&amp;J vaccine due to a rare blood clotting disorder that has occurred in a small number of vaccine recipients. , On Thursday, ACIP will take up several new issues regarding safety and durability of Covid-19 vaccines. To start, ACIP will review recent data on cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) among people who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 with the J&amp;J coronavirus vaccine. Federal health officials say there have been some 100 preliminary reports of cases of GBS -- a rare neurological disorder in which the body\'s immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes temporary paralysis -- among the nearly 13 million people who have received the vaccine. , , The US Food and Drug Administration already last week updated the label of the J&amp;J vaccine to list GBS as a rare risk. ACIP\'s discussion tomorrow will center on the question of whether, given this adverse event, the benefit of the J&amp;J vaccine still outweighs the risk of GBS. ACIP is expected to say it does. , Tomorrow\'s meeting was precipitated by this newly identified adverse event, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and ACIP member, told CNN. \"There will be no formal votes and will come to the conclusion that the risk of Covid is very high and the risks of the vaccine very low. Real, but very low,\" he added. , , ACIP will also take on the subject of coronavirus vaccine boosters with priority given to reviewing data on the need for booster vaccines for immunocompromised people. Recent reports have suggested that Covid-19 vaccines are not effective enough in people with weakened immune systems, and last week the CDC revised its guidance for fully vaccinated individuals. It warned people who are immunocompromised that the vaccines may not be as effective for them, and they are encouraged to continue with safety precautions as if they were not vaccinated. However, the CDC has not yet formally recommended boosters for anyone. , ACIP\'s goal tomorrow is to weigh in on the need for boosters and review what data is currently available and published. \"What [ACIP] will demonstrate tomorrow is that the evidence is very sparse,\" says Schaffner, which ultimately means that the group will not vote on boosters., Earlier this month, Pfizer announced it would be seeking authorization to provide a third dose of its Covid-19 vaccine as a booster, citing data from Israel on the continued spread of the coronavirus and the limited efficacy against the more transmissible Delta variant. , Health officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, continue to say the US needs more data before recommending coronavirus vaccine boosters for anyone. , \"The CDC and the FDA said that based on the data that we know right now, we don\'t need a boost,\" Fauci told CNN\'s Chris Cuomo last week. \"That doesn\'t mean that that won\'t change. We might need, as a matter of fact, at some time to give boosters either across the board or to certain select groups, such as the elderly or those with underlying conditions.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/22/health/acip-meeting-thursday-vaccine-boosters/index.html',1,72),(56,'US life expectancy falls by more than a year due to Covid-19 pandemic, CDC study says','Life expectancy in the United States fell by a year and a half in 2020 primarily due to increases in death due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to early data released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\"U.S. life expectancy at birth for 2020, based on nearly final data, was 77.3 years, the lowest it has been since 2003,\" researchers at the CDC\'s National Center for Health Statistics wrote in a new report published on Wednesday., , US life expectancy declined from 78.8 years in 2019 to 77.3 years in 2020, the researchers reported, and Covid-19 deaths contributed to 73.8% of that decline. , The report was based on provisional data from death and birth records for the year 2020, processed by the National Center for Health Statistics. Since the study relied on recorded deaths and births, some deaths or births that had not yet been counted or recorded were not included in the early data. , The researchers found that life expectancy for men fell from 76.3 years in 2019 to 74.5 in 2020 and life expectancy for women dropped from 81.4 years in 2019 to 80.2 in 2020., There also were some racial disparities that emerged in the data. , , The researchers found that Hispanic people experienced the largest decline in life expectancy between 2019 and 2020, primarily due to Covid-19, decreasing by three years from 81.8 years to 78.8 years. Life expectancy fell by 2.9 years for Black people from 74.7 years to 71.8 years and decreased by 1.2 years for White people, falling from 78.8 years to 77.6 years., \"Mortality due to COVID-19 had, by far, the single greatest effect on the decline in life expectancy at birth between 2019 and 2020, overall, among men and women, and for the three race and Hispanic-origin groups shown in this report,\" the researchers wrote., The decline of a year and half in life expectancy between 2019 and 2020 was mostly due to increases in deaths tied to Covid-19, unintentional injuries, homicide, diabetes and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, the researchers reported. , The overall decline in life expectancy last year would have been even greater were it not for the \"offsetting effect\" of decreases in cancer deaths, the researchers found, as well as decreases in deaths tied to chronic lower respiratory diseases, heart disease, suicide and certain perinatal conditions. , , Earlier this year, the CDC released provisional data showing that Covid-19 was the third leading cause of death in the United States last year. , The death rate from 2019 to 2020 increased by 15.9%, going up from 715.2 to 828.7 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the report., The early data showed that the top 10 leading causes of death in 2020 were:, Heart disease Cancer Covid-19 Unintentional injury Stroke Chronic lower respiratory disease Alzheimer\'s disease Diabetes Influenza and pneumonia Kidney disease','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/21/health/life-expectancy-covid-19-pandemic-cdc-study-wellness/index.html',1,74),(57,'Breastfeeding for any amount of time linked to lower blood pressure in toddlers, study finds','Toddlers who were breastfed for any amount of time had lower blood pressure than those who were not breastfed at all, according to a new study, suggesting once again that \"breast is best\" for health. The reduction in blood pressure found in the study \"is of clinically important magnitude and surprising,\" Dr. Lori Feldman-Winter told CNN in an email. Feldman-Winter, who was not involved in the study, is the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Breastfeeding., \"I may have expected a difference to be apparent just prior to or during adolescence, but the fact that these differences were seen as early as three years of age indicates that breastfeeding participates in metabolic programming that spans the life cycle,\" wrote Feldman-Winter, who is a professor of pediatrics at Rowan University\'s Cooper Medical School., , Any breastfeeding helped, The study, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association, used data from almost 2,400 children who are part of the CHILD (Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development) Cohort Study. CHILD is a longitudinal study that tracks the health of thousands of Canadian mothers and their children born between 2009 and 2012., The study analyzed data on the length of time infants were breastfed and compared it to their blood pressure at age 3. Across the board, breastfed children had lower blood pressure regardless of the amount of time spent breastfeeding. , The finding was unexpected, said senior study author Meghan Azad, deputy director of the CHILD Cohort Study, an associate professor of pediatrics and child health at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada., \"We found, contrary to our expectations, it did not matter how long you were breastfed, whether it was two days, two weeks, two months or two years,\" Azad said. \"We saw an improvement of blood pressure profiles from any breastfeeding at all.\", , Prior research shows extended breastfeeding from six months to over a year lowers an infant\'s risk of obesity, diabetes, gastrointestinal infections and more, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It also reduces the mother\'s risk of some cancers, diabetes and high blood pressure. , A \"dose response\" is often seen, meaning \"the longer, the better\" in relation to protecting against infections and asthma, Azad said. , The official recommendation from the American Academy of Pediatrics is to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months, then continued with complementary foods such as infant cereals, fruits and vegetables for a year or more. , The World Health Organization recommends the same for the first six months, with continued breastfeeding and complementary foods for up to two years of age or longer. , Breastfeeding immediately after birth \'crucial\', Previous studies attempting to examine the link between breastfeeding and children\'s blood pressure have been inconsistent, likely due to varying definitions of breastfeeding, the study noted., Researchers for the current study categorized the children based on the duration of breastfeeding in the first days of life. One such category was \"early limited breastfeeding,\" defined as breastfeeding that only occurred in the hospital. , , Unlike previous research on the subject, Azad said the study was unique because they had this very detailed information about breastfeeding during the hospital stay after birth. This information allowed them to come to the conclusion that even breastfeeding only for the limited one to three days in the hospital is linked with lower blood pressure at age 3. , In these early days of breastfeeding, the mothers are producing colostrum, known to be especially nutritious and immunity-boosting for the infant. , \"The first few days are really crucial,\" Azad said. , The reduction in blood pressure seen in the breastfed children is significant when comparing it to the levels of blood pressure in adults that are associated with lower risk of conditions such as hypertension and stroke, said lead study author Dr. Kozeta Miliku, a postdoctoral fellow at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada and a clinical science officer at the CHILD Cohort Study. , \"The findings that we see on breastfeeding and blood pressure could be clinically relevant,\" Miliku said. \"As a new mom-to-be, this research means a lot to me because it\'s important to understand that every drop counts.\" , Though any amount helps, sustained breastfeeding should still be supported, Miliku added. , Azad recognized different reasons women do not breastfeed: They may not be educated on its impacts, they may feel shamed from societal attitudes toward breastfeeding in public, and some may have clinical reasons for not breastfeeding, among other factors. These must all be acknowledged and tackled by policy makers and health care providers, she said., In light of its findings, the study authors emphasized the need for immediate postpartum lactation support and increased education about breastfeeding to new and expecting mothers. , Similarly, Feldman-Winter said the study makes the case for policies that \"work to improve maternity care practices that support breastfeeding initiation.\", Azad and Miliku hope to continue following this cohort and monitoring whether these differences in blood pressure levels at age 3 impact the participants\' health into adulthood. They also seek to learn more about colostrum and breast milk to understand why they are linked to reduced negative health outcomes.  , Breastfeeding resources, For new mothers who are breastfeeding, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends knowing the signs of correct nursing:, Make sure that your baby\'s mouth is open wide, with their chin and nose resting against the breast. The baby should take as much of the areola into their mouth as they can and suckle rhythmically in short bursts. If you can hear your baby swallow regularly and your nipple feels comfortable, you are nursing correctly. , Incorrect nursing signs include your baby\'s head not being in line with their body, your baby is sucking on the nipple only but not on the areola and your baby\'s cheeks being puckered inward. , If you aren\'t hearing your baby swallow regularly or if you experience pain or nipple damage, you may want to seek advice from your pediatrician or or a lactation consultant such as La Leche League, a non-profit agency dedicated to providing education and support for breastfeeding mothers.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/21/health/breastfeeding-child-lower-blood-pressure-wellness/index.html',1,75),(58,'Here are the precautions people who are immunocompromised should take before returning to the office','Many pandemic restrictions have been lifted for the vaccinated, but for the millions of people with conditions that suppress the immune system, who may not get as much protection from a Covid-19 vaccine, life has been trickier. On Thursday the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will discuss whether immunocompromised people need a third shot to better protect themselves from Covid-19, since the vaccines may not work as well for them. , Until then, people with weaker immune systems still have to figure out how to navigate a return to in-person work and other activities, but they have limited information. , , \"We are getting some questions about this for sure,\" said Dr. Laura Makaroff, the senior vice president for prevention and early detection at the American Cancer Society. , The Covid-19 vaccines work well and for most people they provide significant protection against death and hospitalization; however, no vaccine is 100% protective, and while relatively rare, there have been breakthrough cases. , For people with weaker immune systems, it\'s not always clear how much protection the vaccines offer. These people are also more vulnerable to severe Covid-19 and more vulnerable to having a prolonged infection, which means they\'d also be more likely to transmit the virus to their household members. , , Makaroff said there are ongoing discussions in the cancer community about boosters. A study from Johns Hopkins researchers last month suggested an extra shot may help increase antibody levels for another immunocompromised group: organ transplant recipients, who didn\'t have a full response with their original doses. Some patients report having gotten an extra shot on their own, but so far that\'s not yet what the CDC recommends., \"Unfortunately, it\'s hard to give real specific guidance,\" said Dr. Marci Lynn Drees, the chief infection prevention officer and hospital epidemiologist for ChristianaCare and is the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America\'s liaison to ACIP. \"Just because we know there\'s a risk that they may not respond to the vaccine quite as well, but there is also not a really good commercially available reliable test to say whether they did or didn\'t respond to the vaccine, so it\'s a little bit of guesswork.\" , There are tests to see if people have generated antibodies after vaccination, and some doctors have offered them, but the CDC doesn\'t recommend it., , \"Technically, we have an antibody test for the spike protein. The problem is we don\'t really know what levels are protective,\" said Dr. Amy Edwards, the associate medical director of Pediatric Infection Control at UH Rainbow Babies and Children\'s Hospital in Cleveland. , \"Now we assume if your antibodies are completely negative that you didn\'t respond to the vaccine, but believe it or not, antibodies are not the end all, be all. We know that your T-cell response also plays a huge role in viral immunity,\" Edwards added., \"So the concern is that somebody would get a negative antibody response and think they are not protected. Or the reverse maybe they have antibodies, but their T cells don\'t function very well and they then have false confidence that they are protected,\" Edward said., For now, groups like the American Cancer Society and others have been advising people with a weakened immune system from cancer or its treatment, even the vaccinated, to stick with familiar pandemic public health measures. , The CDC made the same recommendation for certain immunocompromised groups on Friday. The groups included organ transplant recipients, people who are receiving chemotherapy for cancer, people who have certain blood cancers, and people receiving dialysis or taking medications that suppress the immune system., , They should all wear masks in crowds, continue social distancing and be careful about hand hygiene, Makaroff said., The CDC also recommended avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces., , Amber Clayton, who runs the HR Knowledge Center with the Society for Human Resource Management, said some people with an immunocompromised condition may qualify as having a disability under the Americans with Disability Act. They may be able to get what\'s known as a reasonable accommodation. That could include working from home, or a staggered shift, or office space away from others, even if other people are expected back fulltime. \"That way they\'re not exposed,\" Clayton said., If someone is not protected under disability laws, employers may have policies that provide for reasonable accommodations for individuals with what\'s considered \"temporary disabilities.\" , \"Everyone is going to have to assess their own situations and determine what\'s the best option,\" Clayton said., And the best option, for everyone, no matter whether they are immunocompromised, experts say, is to get vaccinated and to encourage everyone else to get vaccinated., \"You know everyone kind of thinks of themselves, but you know the more people we can get vaccinated, the more we protect those who either can\'t be vaccinated because they are young kids or people who have a medical reason,\" said Drees. \"We are all in this together and we\'re not going to all get out of the pandemic and get back to normal until we really get a much higher vaccination rate.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/20/health/covid-19-immunocompromised-precautions/index.html',1,76),(59,'These routine shots already are required in schools, as more states ban Covid-19 vaccine requirements','As debates abound over whether coronavirus vaccinations should be required in public schools, many experts point out that students already are required to receive several other routine vaccinations to attend childcare or classes in the United States., \"There is an irony because we\'ve had these long-standing mandatory vaccination requirements for schools,\" Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told CNN on Monday. , But the singling out of coronavirus vaccines seems to be \"obviously occurring in a broader social and political context around Covid-19 and the extreme politicization of the disease and vaccines,\" Moss said. In addition, children are returning to school this year amid the spread of misinformation about coronavirus vaccines., \"I think another factor here is at least a perception that Covid-19 is not a severe disease in children -- and there\'s no doubt that the risk of severe disease is much lower in children. But it\'s not zero, and many children have been hospitalized with Covid-19,\" Moss said. \"That\'s in contrast to the other vaccines, which are really for childhood infectious diseases.\", US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky pushed back on the framing that Covid-19 didn\'t severely impact children in a Senate hearing on Tuesday, , \"One thing I just want to note with the children is I think we fall into this flawed thinking of saying that only 400 of these 600,000 deaths from Covid-19 have been in children,\" she said. \"Children are not supposed to die.\", The vaccines already required in schools, According to the National Academy for State Health Policy, five routine childhood vaccines are generally required for children attending childcare or school in all states: diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus or DTaP for childcare and schools; Haemophilus influenzae type B or Hib for childcare; measles, mumps and rubella or MMR for childcare and schools; polio for childcare and schools and varicella or chickenpox for childcare and schools., Most school requirements follow the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s vaccine schedule for children. The CDC sets adult and childhood immunization schedules based on recommendations from its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices., ACIP has recommended use of Covid-19 vaccines in children and teens 12 and older., , While all 50 states have laws requiring specific vaccines for students, there are also exemptions. , All school immunization laws grant exemptions to children for medical reasons. As of April, 44 states and Washington, DC also grant religious exemptions for students and 15 of those states allow philosophical exemptions for children, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures., For several other vaccines, long-standing requirements in schools can vary state by state. For instance, vaccination against hepatitis B is required in all states except Alabama, whereas an annual flu shot is only required in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York City, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island., The human papillomavirus, or HPV, vaccine represents an instance where most states have not followed CDC recommendations. The agency recommends the HPV vaccine for adolescents and young adults, but only Washington, DC, and three states -- Hawaii, Rhode Island and Virginia -- require the vaccine for elementary and secondary schools.  , , There are also differences by states when it comes to coronavirus vaccine mandates in schools. In the US, people 12 and older can get a Covid-19 vaccine, but it is not yet authorized for younger children., An updated CNN analysis has found that, as of Monday, at least nine states -- Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Montana, Ohio, Oklahoma and Utah -- have enacted legislation this year that would restrict public schools and universities from requiring either coronavirus vaccinations or documentation of vaccination status. , Moss described these laws as \"tension between public health and individual liberties.\", \"In many cases, including school vaccination mandates, we say the state has the right to sacrifice some individual liberties for the good of the public, and we do that in many ways -- indoor smoking restrictions, wearing seatbelts -- there are many, many examples where we do this, but the vaccine is just a particularly contentious one,\" Moss said. \"So, I see the prohibition of even asking for documentation as a misguided attempt to preserve individual liberties, but at a tradeoff for public health.\", , As of June 22, at least 34 states had introduced bills that would limit requiring someone to demonstrate their vaccination status or immunity against Covid-19, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which has been tracking legislation related to coronavirus vaccines., The laws take different approaches, but the result is that some schools can\'t require coronavirus vaccines, or in some cases, proof of vaccination. For some states, that\'s the case even as schools still expect students to arrive with other recommended childhood vaccinations, including those against measles, whooping cough, polio and chickenpox., Alabama\'s law, for instance, states that \"institutions of education may continue to require a student to prove vaccination status as a condition of attendance only for the specific vaccines that were already required by the institution as of January 1, 2021\" -- which would not include coronavirus vaccines., There\'s also the issue of authorization versus full approval. , In Ohio, the law states that a public school or state institution of higher education shall not \"require an individual to receive a vaccine for which the United States Food and Drug Administration has not granted full approval\" -- and that includes coronavirus vaccines., , \"Covid-19 is a little bit different from these other vaccines because of the way it had to be developed, and so right now we only have an emergency use authorization -- so it\'s not fully authorized. It hasn\'t gone through the entire process with the Food and Drug Administration and we don\'t have years of experience as with other vaccines. That is a difference, I think, in some people\'s minds who have concerns around potential side effects for children,\" Hemi Tewarson, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy, told CNN on Friday.  , \"Now the clinical trials for the EUA were robust. Among the children 12 and above obviously there were not significant side effects and it was safe for children to get this vaccine,\" she added. \"But it is in a different approval phase than all these other vaccines that are currently mandated, so that is a distinction.\", Currently,  three coronavirus vaccines are authorized for emergency use in the United States: two doses of Pfizer/BioNTech for ages 12 and older, two doses of Moderna for ages 18 and older and the one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson for 18 and older. , Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have begun their applications to receive full FDA approval, and Johnson &amp; Johnson has said it intends to file for licensure., Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that the FDA had granted priority review designation to the companies\' application for approval of their Covid-19 vaccine. , , But that might be enough to move many Americans. \"I don\'t think just the FDA approval alone is going to be enough for some,\" Tewarson said.  , \"For some school districts, they might make a different decision depending on what\'s happened within your state and community -- but for others, I think there\'s still going to be the concern that we still don\'t have years of experience with this vaccine and so you cannot require students to get vaccinated,\" she said. \"What we will have to see is what happens if we start seeing -- and I hope this is not the case -- surges of Covid-19 in schools and communities.\" , During the pandemic, rates of hospitalization for Covid-19 among adolescents were nearly three times higher than rates of hospitalization for the flu were from the three most recent flu seasons, according to a CDC report published in June. Among those adolescents hospitalized for Covid-19, about a third required intensive care., The history of vaccine requirements in schools, In US history, schools developed vaccine requirements in response to seeing outbreaks of infectious and devastating diseases among children, which then could spread from schools to surrounding communities., , \"There\'s a long history of mandatory vaccination requirements for school children in the United States. It actually goes way back to the early and mid 19th century with smallpox vaccination,\" Moss said. \"And the history of mandatory vaccination is paralleled by the same history of anti-vaxxers and people against these mandatory requirements.\", The first legal mandate for vaccinations went into place in the United States in the late 19th century when a smallpox epidemic took hold in Massachusetts. The Supreme Court upheld a Massachusetts law in 1905, ruling that the state had authority to enforce vaccination requirements. , At the time, smallpox vaccination was hotly contested, and there were even some anti-vaxxer pamphlets published in 1885 during a smallpox epidemic in Montreal. Smallpox was eradicated in 1979 with a concerted, global vaccination campaign., , Then in the late 1960s and early 1970s there was a renewed focus on vaccinating children in schools because of measles outbreaks. , \"In the 1970s schools were a major site of measles transmissions, and the data showed that states with school immunization laws had rates of measles 40% to 50% lower than those without the laws -- and so school vaccine statutes were broadened in the 70s and more strictly enforced,\" Tewarson said. \"So there were vaccine mandates before the 70s but there was a renewed focus when measles outbreaks happened and people saw the difference when there was higher vaccination rates versus not.\", In 1977, the US federal government launched a nationwide Childhood Immunization Initiative and \"that\'s really when all 50 states adopted these mandatory school vaccination requirements,\" Moss said. \"That childhood immunization initiative in 1977 was kind of the modern catalyst for this.\", , Since 2006, the Association of Immunization Managers has had a longstanding position statement on school and childcare immunization requirements, saying that \"requirements are effective public health tools for increasing immunization coverage in children, preventing vaccine-preventable disease, and preventing transmission of disease in school and child care settings.\" ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/21/health/school-vaccines-requirements-covid-19-wellness/index.html',1,78),(60,'Pediatricians\' group says all kids should wear masks in school, but some states block such mandates','As students return to school in the coming weeks, some will be masked and some won\'t.

The list of schools banning mask mandates has been constantly changing, but so far they are all states with Republican governors., , While there are some differences between the policies in each state, they all point to the same debate at the heart of efforts to return to in-person instruction: Who gets to decide whether to mandate masks in schools -- state politicians or local school officials?, In Utah and Iowa, the governors signed bills passed by the legislatures, cementing the bans on school mask mandates into law. However, in response to concerns that the bill in Utah oversteps local control, it does include a provision allowing schools to require masks during outbreaks only if the decision is made in collaboration with local health departments. , In South Carolina, Texas and Georgia, the governors all signed executive orders taking steps to limit schools\' abilities to implement mask mandates. Their authority to do so \"varies from state to state,\" according to Lindsay Wiley, director of the Health Law and Policy Program at American University., South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster was the first to issue an executive order preventing schools from issuing mask mandates. , \"With regard to mask requirements in public schools, the governor has directed DHEC - in consultation with the S.C. Department of Education - to develop and distribute a standardized form a parent or legal guardian may sign to opt their child out of mask requirements imposed by any public school official or public school district,\" the May 11 order said., , These different state laws prohibiting mask mandates in schools conflict with guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics., The American Academy of Pediatrics released new Covid-19 guidance for schools on Monday that supports in-person learning and recommends universal masking in school of everyone over the age of 2, regardless of vaccination status -- a stricter position than that taken earlier this month by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., The CDC recently updated its Covid-19 school guidance, which also emphasized in-person schooling is a priority in the fall, but advised that fully vaccinated students, teachers and staff do not need to wear masks in school., , The CDC recommendations leave room for local agencies, enterprises, cities and states \"to make a judgment call\" on what should be required or recommended in their communities based on the Covid-19 situation on the ground, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN\'s Kate Bolduan on Monday. , Still, the American Academy of Pediatrics\' stricter position is \"reasonable,\" Fauci said. , The AAP recommendations are along the same lines as what has been recommended in places with a lot of coronavirus transmission, such as Los Angeles County, which recently reinstated its mask mandate amid a rise in cases and hospitalizations. , \"When you have a degree of viral dynamics in the community, and you have a substantial proportion of the population that is unvaccinated, you really want to go the extra step, the extra mile, to make sure that there\'s not a lot of transmission, even breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals,\" Fauci said. \"For that reason, you can understand why the American Academy of Pediatrics might want to do that -- they just want to be extra safe.\", , There are some states -- including Connecticut, Hawaii, New Mexico, New York, Virginia, and Washington -- that follow the AAP guidance to require masks among K-thru-12 students regardless of their vaccination status., \"All school personnel, volunteers, visitors, and students must wear cloth face coverings or an acceptable alternative (e.g., surgical mask) at school when indoors regardless of vaccination status,\" according to guidance from Washington\'s Department of Health, which was updated earlier this month. However, in Washington, masks are not required outdoors., Last week, California quickly reversed its school mask policy after announcing that students who refused to wear a mask indoors would be turned away. For now, the state will require masks but leave decisions on how to handle enforcement up to the districts., \"California\'s school guidance will be clarified regarding masking enforcement, recognizing local schools\' experience in keeping students and educators safe while ensuring schools fully reopen for in-person instruction,\" the California Department of Public Health tweeted.,  , Even among the states requiring masks, there\'s indication policies are still in flux. , New Mexico is standing by its guidance issued in April for now, in which masks are required for all students in school. But New Mexico\'s Public Education Department is revisiting its policy since the CDC has updated its guidance., \"We expect our updated guidance, which will be announced upon completion, to align closely with the CDC\'s recommendations and to continue making the health and safety of children a priority,\" NMPED said in a statement to CNN., Overall, Fauci said that different recommendations can \"indeed cause a bit of confusion.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/20/health/school-mask-mandates-covid-19-cnn-analysis-wellness/index.html',1,79),(61,'Why the Delta variant is spreading so much faster than other coronavirus strains','Worldwide, there is an alarming surge in coronavirus cases -- and health experts say  a key factor in this latest wave is the highly contagious Delta variant.The variant is spreading about 55% faster than the alpha strain that was first identified in the United Kingdom late last year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) -- and that strain spreads about 50% faster than the version that first began infecting people in late 2019., \"We should think about the Delta variant as the 2020 version of Covid-19 on steroids,\" Andy Slavitt, a former senior adviser to President Joe Biden\'s Covid Response Team, told CNN last week., Here\'s what else you need to know about the variant, including why it\'s spreading so quickly. , It was first identified in India, The Delta strain was first identified in India in December 2020. , It rapidly became the dominant variant, overwhelming the country\'s health care system., It was identified in the United Kingdom soon after. , \"This is the most contagious version of the virus we have seen throughout the whole pandemic,\" said Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. \"It\'s really very contagious.\", Now, it\'s spread to all 50 US states, The first case in the United States was identified in March, and by early July, it made up more than half of cases tested in the country. It now makes up 83% of US cases, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)., \"This is a dramatic increase, up from 50% for the week of July 3,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a Senate committee hearing Tuesday. , The Delta variant has been found in all 50 US states., That\'s behind a surge, mainly among unvaccinated people in the country -- the average of new daily cases this week is up 55% from last week, with cases rising in 46 states as of Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Hospitalizations are up 52% over the past 14 days. , The strain continues to spread rapidly , How is the virus spreading so rapidly? One study suggests the Delta variant may transmit faster than other strains because it makes more copies of itself inside our bodies at a faster rate. , When scientists in China compared dozens of cases of delta to strains from early in the pandemic, they found that patients with the Delta variant had viral loads that were 1,260 times higher. , \"There\'s so much more virus around, people who are infected have such high viral loads, but even short periods of time --  five minutes, seven minutes, you don\'t even have to be within six feet,\" Jha said., \"For people who are unvaccinated, they are getting infected with much, much shorter exposure.\", The vaccines available in the United States are proving to be effective against the Delta variant. Although there are breakthrough cases, people who are fully vaccinated rarely become very sick. , But less than half of the US population is fully vaccinated, according to CDC data, and the CDC is warning of a \"pandemic of the unvaccinated.\", \"If you are unvaccinated, you are at great risk right now,\" Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said. \"And you should take measures if you\'re unvaccinated, like masking, distancing, avoiding indoor gatherings.\", More than 97% of people getting hospitalized with Covid-19 now are unvaccinated, Walensky said last week., And 99.5% of deaths are among the unvaccinated, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Sunday., Getting people vaccinated as quickly as possible, Murthy said, \"is our fastest, most effective way out of this pandemic.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/21/health/delta-variant-covid-19-explainer/index.html',1,80),(62,'More infectious Delta variant makes up 83% of new US coronavirus cases as vaccine hesitancy persists','The more contagious \"This is a dramatic increase, up from 50% for the week of July 3,\" Walensky said in a Senate committee hearing. , Health experts have said the Delta variant is more transmissible than any other identified variant so far. \"We should think about the Delta variant as the 2020 version of Covid-19 on steroids,\" Andy Slavitt, a former senior adviser to Joe Biden\'s Covid Response Team, told CNN last week., \"It\'s twice as infectious,\" Slavitt said. \"Fortunately, unlike 2020, we actually have a tool that stops the Delta variant in its tracks: It\'s called vaccine.\", Vaccination rates in the country have stalled though. Less than half of the US population is fully vaccinated, according to CDC data, and the majority of those who are not vaccinated are not at all likely to get vaccinated, according to a poll published Tuesday by Axios-Ipsos. , A quarter or less of those who are unvaccinated said that they would be likely to get the vaccine under certain circumstances, according to the poll, which was conducted July 16 to 19 and made up of a nationally representative sample of 1,048 general population US adults. , If many of those who are holding out do not get inoculated, Dr. Anthony Fauci said, the US can expect a \"smoldering\" outbreak for \"a considerable period of time.\", The rise of the Delta variant comes as the US sees a new uptick in Covid-19 cases and an increase in hospitalizations and deaths, especially in pockets of the country where vaccination rates remain relatively low. , The average of new daily cases this week is up 66% from last week and 145% from two weeks ago, as cases rise in 46 states, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In addition, hospitalizations are up 26% from last week., About 22% of the US population -- nearly 73 million people -- lives in a county considered to have \"high\" Covid-19 transmission, according to data published Monday by the CDC., This is about 10 times what it was in early June, when less than 3% of the population lived in such counties., The CDC considers a county to have high transmission if there have been 100 or more cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 residents or a test positivity rate of 10% or higher in the past seven days. , According to the latest CDC data, about 5% of the US population lives in a county considered to have \"low\" transmission, defined by the CDC as fewer than 10 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 residents and a test positivity rate of less than 5% in the past seven days. , Test positivity rate is one of two indicators used by the CDC to assess community transmission levels. But the number of daily coronavirus tests have dropped off -- down 34% from a month ago -- according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. The CDC did not respond to CNN\'s requests to learn more about this metric., , Vaccines are effective against the Delta variant, data shows, The most recent data from Israel evaluating effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine against the Delta variant found the vaccine to be 64% protective against infection, and that the vaccine is 93% effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalizations. , Other studies indicate that the Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines are also effective against the Delta variant. , And 99.5% of deaths are among the unvaccinated, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN\'s Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" on Sunday -- a figure cited by the CDC earlier in the month., Already some hospitals are again being overwhelmed by Covid-19 patients, Murthy said Monday., \"I am heartbroken to see just how hard (physicians are) working -- how exhausted they are,\" Murthy told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper. \"Many of them are suffering with depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation, as a result of the stress that they have endured during this pandemic.\", Having been tricked by the virus before, Murthy says now is the time to be cautious., \"There have been multiple times when we have been fooled by Covid-19, when cases went down and we thought we were in the clear and then cases went up again,\" Murthy said. \"It means we shouldn\'t let down our guard until cases not only come down but stay down, and right now cases are actually going up. Cases are going up, hospitalizations are going up, death rates are ticking up.\", Murthy urged Americans to get vaccinated -- if not for themselves then for health care workers who need protection from burnout and children who are not yet eligible for the protection provided by the vaccine. , Even if parents are vaccinated, wearing a mask in areas of high transmission risk is \"the right thing to do,\" he said. Murthy -- the father of two children, ages 3 and 4 -- said he takes such precautions because \"I want to take every possible measure to protect my child.\", \"Our kids who cannot get vaccinated, they depend on us being vaccinated to protect them from the spread of the virus. We are their shields,\" Murthy said. \"Even if you don\'t want to do it for yourself, consider getting vaccinated to protect the children in your community. They are depending on us.\", , Pediatrics association recommends masks in schools, In addition to protecting children from infection, many experts and officials have stressed the importance of getting them safely back into the classroom., Most children are at a lower risk than adults for severe disease from Covid-19, and the benefits of learning in a classroom outweigh the risks, said Dr. Greta Massetti, a member of the CDC\'s Covid-19 Emergency Response., \"However,\" she added, \"for some families, particularly those with children or family members who are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, or who cannot get vaccinated, those families might be more comfortable with a remote option this fall.\", On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics released new guidance for schools that supports in-person learning and recommends universal masking in schools for everyone over the age of 2., \"The AAP believes that, at this point in the pandemic, given what we know about low rates of in-school transmission when proper prevention measures are used, together with the availability of effective vaccines for those age 12 years and up, that the benefits of in-person school outweigh the risks in all circumstances,\" the guidance said., The guidance differs some from the CDC recommendations, which advise masks be worn indoors in schools by all individuals who are not fully vaccinated., But Fauci said the CDC leaves flexibility for localities to make judgment calls based on their situation. , And when there is a high rate of virus spread in a community and a low proportion of vaccinated people, \"you really want to go the extra step, the extra mile, to make sure that there\'s not a lot of transmission, even breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals,\" Fauci said. \"They just want to be extra safe.\", There are some states, including Connecticut, Hawaii, New Mexico, New York, Virginia, and Washington, that follow the AAP guidance to require masks among K-thru-12 students regardless of their vaccination status. , But an updated CNN analysis has found that at least nine states -- Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Vermont -- have enacted legislation that prohibit districts from requiring masks in schools.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/20/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html',1,81),(63,'California does a 180 on school mask mandate as state rules vary amid latest CDC guidance ','In a prompt about-face, California announced strict measures barring The announcements came July 12 amid a worrisome spike in new Covid-19 cases reported nationwide since last week. , \"California\'s school guidance will be clarified regarding masking enforcement, recognizing local schools\' experience in keeping students and educators safe while ensuring schools fully reopen for in-person instruction,\" read the update, which arrived via a California Department of Public Health tweet., Earlier, the state had released guidance saying not only that masks were mandated but that schools would be required to \"exclude students from campus if they are not exempt from wearing a face covering under CDPH guidelines and refuse to wear one provided by the school.\" For now, the state will require masks but leave decisions on how to handle enforcement up to the districts., The original statement came across as a policy of \"banning kids,\" so it was rewritten to give schools more flexibility in enforcing or encouraging the use of masks, given that distancing is not possible in most schools, said Alex Stack, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom. , California reported 3,256 new coronavirus cases July 13. It reported tens of thousands of cases daily through December and much of January. Since the pandemic began, it has reported more than 3.7 million cases and 63,478 deaths, according to state data., Cities and states are taking a variety of approaches as the school year approaches. While states such as Texas and Iowa are prohibiting public schools from requiring masks, New York City and Chicago -- two of the nation\'s three most populous cities -- are requiring students to don face coverings in the fall. Chicago officials said, however, they were reviewing the latest CDC guidance. , Rules follow updated guidance, California\'s guidance followed the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s announcement that it was prioritizing in-person learning this school year and that only unvaccinated students and teachers need to abide by mask and distancing protocols. Fully vaccinated students, teachers and staff don\'t need masks in school, the CDC said. , The CDC guidance does not replace local policies, and schools that are prepared to move away from pandemic precautions should do so gradually as community transmission reaches low levels, the agency said. , \"If localities decide to remove prevention strategies in schools based on local conditions, they should remove them one at a time and monitor closely (with adequate testing) for any increases in COVID-19 cases before removing the next prevention strategy,\" the CDC guidance said. , The agency also suggested schools promote vaccination (and even offer vaccines on site), provide paid leave for employees seeking to get vaccinated and excuse absences for students who need to be inoculated., American youngsters must be at least 12 years old to receive an authorized vaccine, and the CDC recommends unvaccinated kids older than 2 wear masks when indoors. , States and localities appear to have broken into three camps on the matter: Some are banning mask mandates outright; more are allowing local officials to make decisions; and a handful are requiring masks. , Officials in several states say they are reviewing the CDC guidance and may update their guidelines. , Illinois announced it would follow the CDC guidance, and at least one local school official told the Daily Herald that her district in the Chicago suburbs of Palatine and Schaumburg did not keep records for Covid-19 vaccinations, as it did for other mandated vaccinations. States have charted different tacks on requiring proof of vaccination., A stark divide develops among districts, At opposite ends of the mask guidance gamut are New York City and Texas. Mayor Bill de Blasio said July 12 that New Yorkers should assume masks will be worn in schools come September unless new developments spur a change in guidance. Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi promised \"additional information for parents and students in the weeks ahead.\", \"For now, we\'re sticking with the idea that wearing the masks is the smart thing to do in schools. We\'ll keep assessing as we go along, but I think for now, it still makes sense,\" de Blasio said, adding that the city will \"be driven by the data we see and the science, as always.\", Chicago -- which announced its reopening last month, meaning businesses could toss capacity limits, most mask mandates and distancing requirements -- says its public schools will require anyone older than 2 to wear masks. The school district has purchased three reusable face coverings for all students and staff, the Chicago Public Schools website said. , The school district had teamed with the public health department to inform parents it was reviewing the new CDC guidance: \"After we have an opportunity to thoroughly review the guidance, we will inform the public about any potential impact on school opening guidance.\", States such as Texas and Iowa have gone in the opposite direction. As of June 4, no public school student or teacher can be required to wear a mask in Texas, and the state will levy a fine of up to $1,000 for any local school, health or other government official who tries to impose such a mandate, according to an executive order signed in May. , \"Texans, not government, should decide their best health practices, which is why masks will not be mandated by public school districts or government entities. We can continue to mitigate COVID-19 while defending Texans\' liberty to choose whether or not they mask up,\" Gov. Greg Abbott said., Iowa, too, passed a law in May forbidding mask mandates in schools. It also included bans on cities and counties requiring masks in businesses. Under the law, students and school employees can be compelled to wear masks only for a \"specific extracurricular or instructional purpose\" or as required for eye and ear protection. , As in Texas, Iowa\'s chief executive and other leaders implied it was a matter of freedom of choice. , \"The state of Iowa is putting parents back in control of their child\'s education and taking greater steps to protect the rights of all Iowans to make their own health care decisions,\" Gov. Kim Reynolds said. \"I am proud to be a governor of a state that values personal responsibility and individual liberties.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/13/health/california-schools-mask-mandate/index.html',1,82),(64,'Covid-19 \'is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,\' CDC director says','With , \"This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,\" US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Rochelle Walensky said during Friday\'s White House Covid-19 briefing., \"We are seeing outbreaks of cases in parts of the country that have low vaccination coverage because unvaccinated people are at risk,\" Walensky said. Meantime, \"communities that are fully vaccinated are generally faring well.\", According to White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients, just four states made up 40% of Covid-19 cases in the past week, \"with one in five cases occurring in Florida alone.\", , , But cases are rising in all 50 states and Washington, DC, with the average of new cases at least 10% higher than a week ago -- and 38 states are seeing at least a 50% increase, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. , The US recorded an average of 26,448 new cases per day over the last week -- up 67% from the week before -- and case rates are highest in states with lower vaccination rates: Among those states that have fully vaccinated less than half its residents, the average Covid-19 case rate was 11 new cases per 100,000 people last week, compared to 4 per 100,000 among states that have fully vaccinated more than half its residents. , Many experts have attributed the rise to slowing vaccination rates with just 48.4% of the US population fully vaccinated, per CDC data., \"Our biggest concern is that we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations and, sadly, deaths among the unvaccinated,\" Walensky said. , The danger is fueled by the growing prevalence of the Delta variant, first identified in India. Pointing to an \"extraordinary surge\" of the variant worldwide, Dr. Anthony Fauci said the Delta variant now has more than 50% dominance in the US. In some areas, it\'s greater than 70%, he said, calling this \"sobering news.\", \"The bottom line is we are dealing with a formidable opponent in the Delta variant,\" Fauci said, adding people who are not vaccinated face \"extreme vulnerability.\" , In Arkansas, where only 35.1% of the population is fully vaccinated, the Delta variant has had a big impact, Chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Cam Patterson said, adding hospitals are \"full right now and cases are doubling every 10 days.\" And emergency response services in the state say there are receiving a record number of calls due to the rise in the virus, according to CNN affiliate KATV., \"The good news is that if you are fully vaccinated, you are protected against severe Covid, hospitalization and death,\" Walensky said Friday, \"and are even protected against the known variants, including the Delta variant.\", \"If you are not vaccinated,\" she added, \"you remain at risk.\", , Experts underscore importance of being fully vaccinated, In response to climbing case numbers, some jurisdictions are opting to reinstate mask guidelines. , In California, Los Angeles County -- the nation\'s largest county with a population of 10 million people -- has responded to a surge in cases and hospitalizations by reinstating a mask mandate beginning Saturday. Health officials in the San Francisco Bay Area are similarly recommending people wear face coverings in indoor public places, regardless of vaccination status. , The Southern Nevada Health District, which serves Las Vegas, is also recommending masks for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, saying masks have been proven effective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus. But vaccinations remain the \"most important and effective step people can take to protect themselves and others from Coivd-19,\" the health district said., Echoing Walensky\'s comments, Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccinologist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said this was also a \"pandemic of the partially vaccinated.\" , \"If these trends continue ... anyone who is unvaccinated -- or possibly even just gotten a single dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine -- there\'s a good likelihood they\'re going to get infected,\" Hotez said., Health officials recommend that people who get their first dose of a vaccine get their second dose three or four weeks later, depending on whether they received the vaccine by Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna. Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s vaccine requires just a single dose., But falling behind schedule shouldn\'t stop people from getting their second dose, Walensky said Friday. , \"If you are beyond that window, I want to reiterate: There is no bad time to get your second shot,\" Walensky said Friday., Both vaccines exceed 90% effectiveness against severe disease, hospitalization and deaths in real-world  studies, she said. But those who are only partially vaccinated still face a risk of illness. , \"Do it for yourself, your family and for your community,\" Walensky said. \"And please, do it for your young children who right now can\'t get vaccinated themselves.\", Vaccine misinformation costing lives, Meanwhile, key reasons for the hesitancy around Covid-19 vaccines are mistrust and misinformation, according to a CNN analysis of data from the US Census Bureau\'s Household Pulse Survey. , Nearly half of people who said they will \"definitely\" or \"probably\" not get a Covid-19 vaccine cited mistrust in the vaccines as a reason for not getting vaccinated, according to the latest data, published Wednesday and based on survey responses from June 23 to July 5. That\'s an increase from about a month ago, when 46% of people who said they did not plan to be vaccinated gave the same reason. , \"Millions of people don\'t have access to accurate information right now, because on social media platforms and other tech platforms we\'re seeing the rampant spread of misinformation, and it\'s costing people their lives,\" US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN\'s Jake Tapper. , Much of that information frequently comes out of people with good intent, he added, saying that they think they are spreading helpful information, but that often misinformation spreads more quickly than accurate information. , US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra agreed, telling CNN\'s Poppy Harlow, \"People are being told things that aren\'t true, and they\'re becoming more hesitant.\" , \"But fortunately, there are people who are seeing the facts,\" he said. \"They\'re seeing a loved one, unfortunately, get hospitalized, maybe die. And they\'re changing their minds.\" , One of the best ways to combat the misinformation, Murthy said, is to have conversations with your friends and family. , \"It\'s about peers talking to peers,\" Murthy said during a Stanford University panel event on Thursday. \"Remember, all of these conversations first start with listening... so try to understand where somebody is coming from, why they may be worried. It may not always be what you think.\", Colleges and universities requiring vaccinations, Some businesses and hospitals have already required their employees to be vaccinated, and now some universities are implementing requirements as well. , Rhode Island has become the first state where all public and private colleges and universities require their students to be fully vaccinated before returning to campus this fall, Governor Dan McKee announced this week., Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, Rhode Island\'s director of health, said in a news release vaccinations are \"key\" to having a successful academic year, and the Delta variant was \"circulating in parts of the country where many of our students live.\", , , The University of California, the nation\'s largest public university system, plans to mandate all students, faculty and staff be fully vaccinated before returning to campuses in the fall. Those who are not exempt from receiving the vaccine will be barred from in-person classes, activities and housing, UC officials announced Thursday., The Association of American Medical Colleges Friday also urged its member institutions to require vaccinations for employees to protect patients and health care personnel. President Dr. David Skorton acknowledged the \"sensitive nature\" of the recommendation, saying AAMC understood such requirements would be subject to state laws. , Such mandates for employees could become easier for private companies as the vaccine approval process move further along. Each vaccine available in the US has been authorized for emergency use. But the companies are still working toward full US Food and Drug Administration approval. , Pfizer and BioNTech said Friday their application for full approval of their vaccine was granted priority review by the FDA, and an FDA official told CNN a decision on full approval is likely to come within two months., Full approval will \"clear up any legal questions that private employers may have,\" former US Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Tuesday. Employers, schools and universities, she said, should \"get more serious\" about telling people that choosing to not get vaccinated could mean losing access to places that could put others at risk. , \"I think that it\'s time to say to those folks, \'It\'s fine if you don\'t choose to get vaccinated, (but) you may not come to work.\'\", , Correction: This story has been updated with the correct spelling of David Skorton\'s last name.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/16/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html',1,84),(65,'Study estimates 1.5 million children lost parents or grandparents to Covid-19','More than a million children around the world have lost a parent to Covid-19, and a total of 1.5 million have lost either a parent, a grandparent who helped care for them or some other relative responsible for their care, a new study finds.\"Covid-19 has created this urgent crisis affecting children in almost every nation,\" Dr. Susan Hillis of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response Team, who worked on the study, told CNN., \"For every two Covid-19 deaths, one child faces the death of a parent or caregiver.\", The team -- including researchers from the CDC, USAID, the World Bank, University College London and elsewhere -- counted deaths in 21 countries that accounted for more than 76% of all Covid cases. They used methods developed and validated years ago to estimate the number of children globally who would have been orphaned by AIDS to forecast the number of Covid-19 orphans., , , \"Globally, from March 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, we estimate 1,134,000 children experienced the death of primary caregivers, including at least one parent or custodial grandparent,\" they wrote in a report published in the Lancet medical journal. Plus, they added, \"1,562,000 children experienced the death of at least one primary or secondary caregiver.\", Kids who lose a parent or caregiver are not only immediately stressed; they are also more likely to suffer diseases themselves, to be abused, and to suffer poverty, the researchers said., \"There are very severe consequences,\" Hillis said. \"The consequences of all these adversities are often lifelong,\" she added., , , \"Children losing primary caregivers have higher risks of experiencing mental health problems; physical, emotional, and sexual violence; and family poverty,\" the team wrote. \"These adverse experiences raise risks of suicide, adolescent pregnancy, infectious diseases including HIV/ AIDS, and chronic diseases.\", Grandparents are more important than might initially be evident, they added. \"In the USA, 40% of grandparents living with grandchildren serve as their primary caregivers; in the UK, 40% of grandparents provide regular care for grandchildren,\" the researchers wrote., Losing a grandparent can be more than merely upsetting. \"The death of grandparents can also reduce the psychosocial, practical, and/or financial support for their grandchildren,\" the researchers wrote in a linked online report. \"These types of vulnerabilities often place children in need of alternative or supplementary care, such as kinship or foster care.\", , But the pandemic has damaged the ability to provide even this less-than-desirable level of care for kids. \"However, public health responses to the pandemic, such as stay-at-home orders and the constraints of conducting child protection evaluations remotely, have severely reduced the capacity of established child protection systems and services to provide much needed child safety interventions and support,\" the report reads., \"These 1.5 million children are the tragic overlooked consequence of the more than 3 million COVID-19-associated deaths by April 30, 2021,\" the researchers added. \"Orphanhood and caregiver deaths are a hidden pandemic resulting from COVID-19-associated deaths.\", , , What to do about it? Number one, the researchers recommend: get Covid-19 vaccines to everyone as quickly as possible, and help prevent infections in other ways including mask use and distancing., \"As soon as a primary caregiver becomes seriously ill with COVID-19, or a family becomes seriously impacted by other pandemic-associated factors, that family should receive comprehensive evaluation including testing, tracing, and appropriate and supported quarantine of exposed family members. The family should be supported in developing a plan for how children might be cared for if their caregiver were to die,\" they added., And societies need to help families affected by the pandemic with economic, educational and mental health support, the report recommends., , Low-cost services to provide all these are already available and there\'s evidence to support what works, the researchers said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/20/health/covid-orphans-lancet/index.html',1,85),(66,'2020 was a record year for stress, hitting mothers with children at home hardest ','The pandemic year that will go down in history set records for stress, worry, anger and sadness among both men and women worldwide, according to a new planetary survey of emotions in 2020 . Stress levels rose the most, with a \"record-high 40% of adults worldwide\" saying they experienced stress \"a lot of the previous day,\" according to Gallup\'s 2021 Global Emotions Index. That was the highest level in the 15 years, the report said., Globally, women with young children at home bore the brunt of the stress, worry, anger and sadness that people experienced during the pandemic of 2020 ., Stress increased in half of the 116 countries surveyed, with \"double-digit increases in stress in 21 countries,\" the report said. That means almost 190 million more people worldwide experienced significant stress last year than in years past., Sickness and death from Covid-19 was obviously a huge part of the stress and negative emotions, as was the economic impact of the pandemic, the survey found., \"Half of those working at the time of the pandemic said they earned less money because of COVID-19, and 32% of people said they lost their job,\" Jon Clifton, Gallup\'s global managing partner, wrote in his opening statement on the survey., \"In all, 80% of people said COVID-19 affected them in some way.\" , Not every country experienced stress during 2020, the report noted. It ranged from a high of 66% in Peru, \"which represents a new high for the country,\" to a \"low of 13% in Kyrgyzstan, where stress levels have historically been low and stayed low in 2020,\" the report said., A negative trend continues, For 15 consecutive years, polling giant Gallup has asked people around the world about their positive and negative emotions. For this report, Gallup surveyed nationally representative samples of 160,000 people from 116 countries during 2020 and early 2021. , Just as it did in 2019, Iraq led the world on the negative experience index in 2020. Gallup found 56% of Iraqis said they experienced pain, 51% reported anger and 50% reported  sadness. , Taiwan scored lowest on the negative emotion index, the same ranking it attained in 2019., Globally, the increase in negative emotions actually began 10 years ago, the report said. One key reason is political and economic upheaval. Partly for those reasons, people in Lebanon and Turkey reported few positive experiences in the survey., \"The majority of Lebanese people have not experienced enjoyment in their daily lives since 2018, and for Turks, this has been true since 2017,\" the report said., Besides political and economic turmoil, another reason for negativity in many nations was a growing belief that both governments and businesses are corrupt., \"Majorities of people believe corruption is widespread in the governments of 79 out of 101 countries and areas in the world, and a majority in 85 out of 110 countries think this is true of businesses,\" Clifton wrote in his introductory remarks., Income inequality is another factor in how people view their lives, Clifton continued: \"Many countries that report high income inequality also happen to be the countries that report a lot of negative emotions, such as anger.\", Resilience still prevailed, While negative emotions rose, many people in the world showed surprising resilience, the survey found. For their positive emotion index, the polling group asked questions about feeling respected and well rested, doing interesting or enjoyable activities, and smiling and laughing. , Results showed that globally, humankind managed to remain stable in positive emotions despite the negative impact of the pandemic -- with the exception of laughing and smiling., \"In the span of a year, the percentage of people who said they smiled or laughed a lot the previous day dropped from 75% to 70%, which is also the lowest measure Gallup has ever recorded for this question,\" the report said., El Salvador led the world in positivity, with an index score of 82. Latin American countries have traditionally dominated the positive index, and Nicaragua, Paraguay and Colombia also had high scores. Three Nordic countries, Iceland, Norway and Finland -- who are traditionally in the top 10 on rankings of national happiness -- also had high scores., The United States did not rank in the top 10 in positivity. But Gallup interviews done for the survey in early 2021, around the time vaccines were being approved, found people\'s ratings of their lives rebounded and hit \"new all-time highs,\" the report said.

This latest renewal is effective starting Tuesday and will continue for another 90 days., A public health emergency declaration, which can last for the duration of the emergency or 90 days, allows for the emergency use authorization of vaccines, the access of certain funds to address the emergency, and the deployment of military trauma care providers, among other factors., The White House had signaled for weeks that it planned to extend the public health emergency determination. In June, local health officials told CNN that the White House was expected to extend its declaration of a national public health emergency due to the pandemic., \"They are committed to ensuring that the emergency order remains in place through the end of the year -- even as they recognize that the current order is about to expire in July,\" Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of City and County Health Officials, told CNN last month., \"There are a lot of things tied to that public health emergency order, including it helps states and local jurisdictions with the pandemic response, but it can be impactful to other forms of assistance like Medicaid eligibility coverage provisions that were changed under the declaration of a public health emergency order,\" Freeman said. \"If an emergency order is lifted, some people could no longer be eligible for some of the health-related coverages that they had gotten under the emergency.\", The nation\'s public health emergency has been in place since late January 2020.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/20/health/covid-19-public-health-emergency-renewal-bn/index.html',1,87),(68,'Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths are increasing, and the vast majority were not vaccinated','The surge in Covid-19 cases Data from Johns Hopkins University shows: , -- The average number of new Covid-19 cases each day the past week was 32,278.

That\'s a 26% increase from last week and a 50% increase from two weeks ago. , There\'s a common theme among those behind the worsening Covid-19 numbers, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:, \"This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,\" Walensky said at a Covid-19 briefing Friday. , More than 97% of people getting hospitalized with Covid-19 now are unvaccinated, Walensky said. , And 99.5% of deaths are among the unvaccinated, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Sunday.  , Getting people vaccinated as quickly as possible \"is our fastest, most effective way out of this pandemic,\" Murthy said., California reports highest Covid-19 test positivity rate since winter surge, The surge in new cases in California -- driven primarily by the highly contagious Delta variant -- continues to swell, now reaching levels not seen since February when new cases were dropping after a huge winter spike., More than 14,000 new coronavirus cases were reported Monday, driving the number of confirmed cases to 3,762,462. California\'s Department of Public Health no longer reports new data on weekends, so Monday\'s number reflects cases reported on Friday, Saturday and Sunday., The state\'s test positivity rate has skyrocketed almost 500% since the beginning of June, climbing to 4.1% on Monday. That rate is the highest the state has seen since February 17, state data shows, a substantial increase since its lowest point of 0.7% on June 7, just before the statewide reopening., \"This is a pandemic overwhelmingly and disproportionately of those that have not been vaccinated,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday., The state is making an effort to refocus its vaccination push on small mobile clinics and additional outreach to unvaccinated subsets, Newsom said. , Among those are unhoused people, those living in rural communities, and those who he says have been deceived by misinformation., About half of the state\'s population is once again under mask mandates and recommendations, with four more central and northern California counties -- Napa, Santa Cruz, San Benito and Monterey -- issuing mask recommendations Monday., Hospitals \'are going to have real problems\' at this rate, At the University of Florida Health Jacksonville, doctors are seeing a sharper increase in Covid-19 patients now than during the January surge, said Chad Neilsen, director of infection prevention. , \"We have doubled our number of Covid hospitalizations over the last week, and it\'s a much more exponential increase in patients versus what we saw in January,\" Neilsen said Monday. , \"My greatest fear is that patients continue to pour in, and we\'re unable to give them the care that we need because we don\'t have staff or resources.\", As of Monday, Neilsen said the hospital had enough beds and supplies. , \"But staffing shortages are really starting to affect not only us, but the rest of the hospital community here in Jacksonville,\" he said. \"If we don\'t have staff to take care of patients, that\'s when we\'re going to have real problems.\" , An official at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences also expressed concerns about the future of patient care if the rapid rise in Covid-19 patients doesn\'t slow down. , On Thursday, Chancellor Cam Patterson said during a Twitter Q&amp;A that hospitals are \"full right now and cases are doubling every 10 days.\", \"If that trend continues, there will be significant challenges in providing care for both Covid and non-Covid patients over the next two weeks,\" Patterson said., Pediatricians: Everyone over age 2 should wear masks in school, On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended universal masking in schools for everyone over the age of 2, regardless of vaccination status, unless a medical or developmental condition prohibits wearing a mask. , The AAP cited several reasons, including the fact that children under 12 are not yet eligible for vaccination., \"There are many children and others who cannot be vaccinated,\" said Dr. Sara Bode, chair-elect of the AAP Council on School Health Executive Committee., \"This is why it\'s important to use every tool in our toolkit to safeguard children from COVID-19. Universal masking is one of those tools, and has been proven effective in protecting people against other respiratory diseases, as well. It\'s also the most effective strategy to create consistent messages and expectations among students without the added burden of needing to monitor everyone\'s vaccination status.\", According to a CNN analysis, at least nine states -- Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Vermont -- have enacted legislation that prohibits districts from requiring masks in schools. All nine states have Republican governors. , Some states -- including Connecticut, Hawaii, New Mexico, New York, Virginia and Washington -- follow the AAP guidance to require masks among K-thru-12 students regardless of their vaccination status. , Doctors say one important reason adults should get vaccinated is to protect children who are not yet eligible for the vaccine., \"Our kids who are not vaccinated, they depend on us to protect them from the spread of the virus. We are their shields,\" US Surgeon General Dr. Vivel Murthy told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper on Monday. , \"And so even if you don\'t want to do it for yourself, consider getting vaccinated to protect the children in your community. They are depending on us,\" Murthy said., Currently, Covid-19 vaccines are only authorized for children 12 and older, but studies are underway to test the safety and efficacy of vaccinating younger children., With those pediatric trials, \"thus far, things look good, but the final decision is going to be up to the FDA,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases., \"And I would imagine that likely will not happen until we get well into the winter, towards the end of this year.\" , Delta variant sends younger people to the hospital, The director-general of the World Health Organization said the Delta variant is the most contagious strain of coronavirus identified. , In research posted online, scientists examining 62 cases of the Delta variant found viral loads about 1,260 times higher than those found in 63 cases from the early epidemic wave in 2020., The Delta variant is also sending younger and previously healthy people to hospitals -- the vast majority of which have not been vaccinated, say doctors in several states suffering surges., \"This year\'s virus is not last year\'s virus,\" said Dr. Catherine O\'Neal, an infectious disease specialist at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana., \"It\'s attacking our 40-year-olds. It\'s attacking our parents and young grandparents. And it\'s getting our kids,\" O\'Neal said. She said her Covid-19 unit now has more patients in their 20s than previously during the pandemic., In the face of rampant misinformation about the virus and the vaccine, McClure urged people to use trusted sources and to \"make sure people have good information.\" , Misinformation \"takes away our freedom,\" Murthy said, adding that the inaccurate information inhibits people\'s power to make educated decisions about the health of themselves and their families. , And with the virus\' disproportionately higher impact among people who aren\'t vaccinated, the consequences can be severe. , \"All this misinformation that\'s floating around is having a real cost that can be measured in lives lost, and that is tragic,\" Murthy said., Trump administration official: Delta will likely hit those unprotected, Most Americans who are unprotected will likely contract the rapidly spreading Delta variant, said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration during the Trump administration. , \"And for most people who get this Delta variant, it\'s going to be the most serious virus that they get in their lifetime in terms of the risk of putting them in the hospital,\" Gottlieb told CBS\' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday., Delta is the most transmissible Covid-19 variant yet, said Murthy and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. , \"This is a virus that has now shown us that it has a very strong capability of more efficiently spreading from person to person than the previous prototype viruses that we\'ve experienced,\" Fauci said Monday., Fauci said vaccinated people are still protected \"very well -- to the tune of 90% or more -- against hospitalizations, severe disease and deaths,\" and that this has \"held strong, regardless of where the study is -- in the United States or in several foreign countries.\", \"So although you\'re dealing with a virus that because of this extreme capability of spreading from person to person, is causing more infections including breakthrough infections of vaccinated people, for those who are vaccinated, it\'s still doing very well against severe disease,\" he said., \"Unfortunately, we can\'t say the same for unvaccinated people ... we can expect among the unvaccinated hospitalizations and eventually, in some situations, deaths.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/19/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html',1,89),(69,'Feeling anxiety about your body image coming out of lockdown? Here are 8 ways to combat it','Being able to socialize again may bring enthusiasm and a sense of normalcy -- but it may also increase anxiety over how your body might have changed.I am a psychologist who has studied body image for over 20 years, and I\'ve seen how the COVID-19 pandemic could affect health and well-being in numerous ways, including body image. Gyms were closed. Self-care rituals may have fallen by the wayside as stress and hardships like homeschooling and strained finances piled up. The pandemic also took away a major way people cope: Social support through physical contact., Pandemic stress has led many people to turn to other coping mechanisms, some of which were harmful to both physical and mental health. In one study of 5,469 adults in Australia, 35% reported increased binge eating, or eating large amounts of food in a short amount of time, due to pandemic life. In another study of 365 adults in Italy, 25.7% reported increased emotional eating over the course of lockdown. And in a survey of 3,000 adults in the U.S., 61% experienced undesired weight changes since the start of the pandemic. It\'s no wonder that people may feel anxiety over what others think about their changed appearance., What is body image?, Body image is a person\'s \"inside view\" -- or feelings, perceptions, thoughts and beliefs -- of their body. Body image can be positive, neutral or negative, and it can fluctuate. Situations that provoke negative body image -- like not fitting into formerly comfortable clothes, noticing age-related changes in appearance, seeing an unflattering picture of yourself and comparing your body to a social media influencer -- are called body image threats., Body image threats have been part of the COVID-19 experience for many people. The pandemic has also seen an increase in struggles with eating too much or too little, preoccupation with food, and anxiety about weight and body shape., Fortunately, there are healthy ways to manage body anxiety and cultivate a positive body image while reemerging from the pandemic., 1. Focus on what you appreciate about your body, Rather than focusing on what has changed or what you don\'t like about your body, focus on what your body does for you. This is different for everyone. For example, my arms allow me to hug my dogs, my legs allow me to take them for walks, my stomach allows me to digest food so I have energy and my brain helped me write this article. Your body is much more than its appearance. Appreciating your body and what it does for you is central to cultivating positive body image., 2. Engage with others who accept and appreciate all bodies, Be selective with who you want to spend time with after the pandemic. Start with people who are \"body accepting,\" meaning they don\'t talk badly about your body, their body or anyone else\'s body -- they may not even focus on appearance at all. Positive body image increases when people engage with others who are body accepting. You can also practice being a person who shows body acceptance to others and pay it forward., 3. Practice self-compassion, People\'s bodies have helped them survive the trauma of a global pandemic. It\'s important to be kind to yourself and your body if your appearance has changed. Self-compassion is being as kind to yourself as you would to a loved one going through a hard situation. Many studies have found that self-compassion is linked to higher positive body image, and self-judgment is linked to a higher negative body image. Try to be mindful, or aware, of your experiences without judging them, and understand that others are in these difficult experiences with you., 4. Engage in mindful movement, If you are able, move your body in ways that bring you joy and rejuvenation and help you connect with and listen to your body. Bodies and abilities are different, and what is mindful movement for someone else may not be for you. Some activities, such as yoga, have been shown to promote positive body image as long as they don\'t focus on appearance. Move in ways that help you focus on how much you enjoy moving rather than how you look while moving., 5. Practice self-care, Ask your body what it needs every day. Bodies need a regular supply of fuel, hydration, relaxation, stimulation and sleep. Self-care can be hard to fit into a schedule, but it is very important to plan actions and activities that restore you to your best self., 6. Engage with nature, Interacting with nature is associated with a variety of health benefits, including higher positive body image. Activities that engage with nature, like hiking, may help you focus less on your appearance and more on how your body functions. Experiencing the beauty of nature can also help create opportunities for self-care, such as through rejuvenation and mindful movement., 7. Refrain from body comparison, It\'s common for people to compare themselves to others. However, when they frequently compare their appearance to others perceived as more attractive, their body image becomes more negative. Body comparison can occur in many settings, and not just through social media -- it can also happen in commonplace settings such as the beach, supermarket and school. When you find yourself comparing your body to others and start to feel negatively about your body, try one of the strategies above to restore a positive body image., 8. Avoid the diet hype, Studies show that dieting does not work: It is not associated with long-term weight loss and often decreases overall well-being. Instead, focus on fueling your body when you are hungry with foods that provide your body with lasting energy. Eating intuitively -- using your natural hunger, appetite and satiety cues to determine when, what and how much to eat -- is linked to health and well-being., Reemerging from the pandemic with confidence, There are many strategies to help build a positive body image, and resources are available to help you find one that works best for you. For those struggling with an eating disorder or severe negative body image, professional help is the best path forward., Positive body image isn\'t just about feeling good about your appearance -- it\'s also accepting and loving your body, regardless of how it looks, and engaging in self-care to attend to its needs. Practice these strategies regularly to promote and maintain positive body image as you safely and confidently reenter your social world., ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/19/health/body-image-anxiety-lockdown-wellness-partner/index.html',1,92),(70,'Covid-19 vaccine myths: These reasons for not getting a shot don\'t hold up. In fact, they\'ll set the US back','Americans have an easy way to crush Covid-19 -- one that would let more businesses fully reopen safely, reduce the need for masks and help prevent But many don\'t want to get vaccinated as myths and misunderstandings spread., As of mid-July, less than 60% of eligible Americans ages 12 and up have been fully vaccinated., That\'s a big problem for several reasons: , -- More than 97% of people now entering the hospital with Covid-19 are not vaccinated, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in mid-July. They include children and young, previously healthy adults. (More on that later.), -- Unless more people get vaccinated, we may never reach herd immunity. , -- The longer people stay unvaccinated, the more chances a virus has to mutate. And if the mutations are significant, they could lead to more troubling strains that might evade vaccines. , -- \'Long Covid\' is real. Even young athletes have suffered brain fog, chest pains and shortness of breath months after infection., \"Even for young people who consider their risk of severe Covid to be low, the long-term consequences can be quite serious,\" said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health., But rampant myths and unnecessary concerns stand in the way. Here are some of the most popular arguments for not getting vaccinated and why doctors want to set the record straight:, , \'I don\'t want to get Covid-19 from the vaccine\', It\'s literally impossible to get Covid-19 from any of the vaccines used in the US because none of them contains even a piece of real coronavirus., Here\'s how each vaccine was made., \'We don\'t know what the long-term side effects are\', Any adverse side effects from vaccines almost always \"show up within the first two weeks, and certainly by the first two months,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. , That\'s why he and many other health experts asked the US Food and Drug Administration to wait at least two months after trial participants had been inoculated before considering whether to give emergency authorization to Covid-19 vaccines. , \"If there were going to (be) problems ... they would become apparent within two months of people getting vaccinated,\" he said. \"That\'s what the FDA waited for.\", The most serious vaccine side effects in history have all been caught within six weeks, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\'s Hospital in Philadelphia and a member of the FDA\'s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee., \"I would say, please tell me what vaccine has ever been shown to cause a long-term side effect that was not picked up in the first two months,\" said Offit, a co-creator of the rotavirus vaccine who has studied vaccinology for more than four decades. , \"The smallpox vaccine could cause inflammation of the heart muscle. The oral polio vaccine was a rare cause of polio -- it occurred in roughly 1 in 2.4 million doses. ... The yellow fever vaccine is a rare cause of ... yellow fever. All those occurred within six weeks of getting a dose,\" he said. , There may be very rare side effects that aren\'t immediately found in clinical trials. But that\'s due to the extreme rarity of those side effects -- \"not because it\'s a long-term problem,\" Offit said., \"Sometimes you\'re not going to pick it up initially because it\'s extremely rare, so you aren\'t going to pick up a one-in-a-million risk in a trial of 44,000 people,\" he said. , Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson &amp; Johnson had about 44,000 participants in each of their trials. Half the volunteers got vaccinated, and the other half got placebos. , The Moderna trial had about 30,000 participants, with half receiving vaccines and half receiving placebos. , And because coronavirus is highly contagious -- killing more than half a million Americans and leaving many survivors with long-term complications -- you\'re much better off getting the vaccine., \'I\'ve already had Covid-19, so I don\'t need to be vaccinated\', Even if you\'ve had coronavirus, you should still get vaccinated because the immunity you get from vaccination will likely be longer or stronger than the immunity you got after getting infected, health experts say., \"That\'s true for a number of vaccines -- the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine induces immunity better than natural infection. The tetanus vaccine does,\" Offit said.  , When it comes to the two-dose vaccines -- those from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna -- people who\'ve already had coronavirus should still get both doses, emergency medicine physician Dr. Leana Wen said., Those vaccines were studied in people taking both doses, and that\'s what experts know to be effective. It\'s not clear how long protection after just one dose might last. , \"We also don\'t know how long protection will last after having coronavirus, so you should still be (fully) vaccinated,\" Wen said., \'The vaccine might hurt my fertility\' , This is pure nonsense, Offit said. , There\'s no evidence that people have lost any fertility because of the Covid-19 vaccines., The rumor apparently started with the myth that the coronavirus spike protein, which is mimicked when you get a vaccine, also mimics the protein on the surface of placental cells, Offit said. , \"So the false notion was that when you\'re making an immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, you also were inadvertently making a response to a placental protein -- which would then make you less likely to be fertile,\" Offit said. , \"So it\'s all nonsense. It\'s not true.\" , The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also said there\'s no link between any vaccines and fertility. , \"If you are trying to become pregnant now or want to get pregnant in the future, you may receive a COVID-19 vaccine when one is available to you,\" the CDC says., \"There is currently no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems.\", The benefits of getting vaccinated if you\'re pregnant or trying to become pregnant far outweigh the risks, because pregnancy puts a person at higher risk for severe Covid-19 illness., And some research suggests Covid-19 vaccines provide some level of protection to newborns. , \'It\'s none of your business if I don\'t get vaccinated\', Refusing the Covid-19 vaccine actually impacts a lot of people -- yourself, your loved ones, even the country as a whole., \"When people say, \'What do you care? You\'re vaccinated. I\'m going to choose not to be vaccinated. You\'re vaccinated, so you\'re good\'\" -- that makes three false assumptions, Offit said. , \"First of all, the vaccines aren\'t 100% effective.\" So even if your friends and family are vaccinated, but you\'re not vaccinated, you can still carry and spread the virus to your loved ones., And as Americans go back to crowded bars, concerts, sporting events and movie theaters, the need for mass vaccination becomes even more important. , Second, it\'s a mistake to think everyone who wants a vaccine can just get one. \"Some people are on cancer chemotherapy. They can\'t be vaccinated -- they depend on the herd to protect them,\" Offit said. , So many of the most vulnerable Americans are counting on fellow Americans to get vaccinated., \"And third, by not being vaccinated, or being part of a reasonably sized group of people who are choosing not to get the vaccine, you\'re allowing the virus to continue to replicate. When it\'s allowed to continue to replicate, it will create mutations, which could then cause variants that are completely resistant to the immunity induced by natural infection or immunization.\", In other words: Failing to get a vaccine could make the vaccines less effective. And that could ruin everyone\'s vaccinations -- throwing the country backward in this pandemic. , \'I\'m young and healthy, so I don\'t need to get vaccinated\', It\'s critical for young, healthy people to get vaccinated, Collins and other doctors say. Here\'s why:, Young people can get long-term Covid-19 complications. Young, healthy people have turned into Covid-19 \"long-haulers,\" suffering chronic fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath and brain fog months after their infection. , A study this year found that 30% of people who had Covid-19 still had symptoms up to nine months after infection., \"Covid-19 doesn\'t have to kill you to wreck your life,\" said Dr. Jonathan Reiner, professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University., Young people can be easy transmitters of coronavirus. There have been multiple Covid-19 outbreaks at youth summer camps. , And with the more contagious Delta variant spreading, hospitals in less-vaccinated states are seeing more children and teens hospitalized with Covid-19., \"This year\'s virus is not last year\'s virus,\" said Dr. Catherine O\'Neal, an infectious disease specialist at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana., \"It\'s attacking our 40-year-olds. It\'s attacking our parents and young grandparents. And it\'s getting our kids.\" , In mid-July, O\'Neal\'s Covid-19 unit had more patients in their 20s who were previously healthy, she said., In Missouri, \"people in their late teens and even early 20s are being hospitalized and needing the use of ventilators,\" said Katie Towns, acting director of Springfield-Greene County Health Department., Young adults can be victims of their strong immune systems. Doctors have noticed some young, previously healthy patients suffer from Covid-19 cytokine storms. That\'s basically when someone\'s immune system overreacts -- potentially causing severe inflammation or other serious symptoms. , \"We\'ve certainly seen people come into our hospital, very young people (in their early 20s) ... need to be put on ECMO, which is basically a heart-lung machine, for days or even weeks because they come in with cardiomyopathy, which is a response to a cytokine storm,\" Reiner said., \'These vaccines only have emergency use authorization, not full FDA approval\', It\'s true that the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines have emergency use authorization from the FDA and not full approval yet. , But that\'s only because not enough time has passed to show how long the vaccines stay effective, Offit said. , \"Frankly, the only real difference was in length of follow-up,\" he said. \"Typically, you like to see efficacy for a year or two years.\", But with Covid-19 vaccines, \"you couldn\'t do that. You couldn\'t do a one- or two- or three-year study ... because the virus was killing hundreds of thousands of people. So we wanted to get it out there.\" , He stressed that the vaccines\' EUA status doesn\'t mean they\'re less safe. As a member of the FDA vaccine advisory committee, Offit said the vaccines are reviewed with the same level of scrutiny as they would to get full approval. , Offit said he\'s confident the vaccines will get full FDA approval., \"The effectiveness and efficacy data in the Phase 3 trials and now in the real world ... is excellent,\" he said. , Also, the vaccine trials showed \"excellent cellular immune responses -- meaning so-called T helper cells.\" Offit said that\'s a good sign these vaccines give strong, long-lasting protection., \'My faith will protect me, so I don\'t need to get vaccinated\', Among religious groups in the US, \"white evangelical Protestants stand out as the most likely to say they will refuse to get vaccinated (26%), with an additional 28% who are hesitant,\" according to a study this spring by the Public Religion Research Institute and Interfaith Youth Core. , Some experts say anti-Covid-19 vaccine sentiment among evangelicals is fueled by a distrust in government, ignorance about how vaccines work and misinformation., \"If you believe that God created us in his image, including being able to think and reason, we\'ve been able to think and reason a lot of these diseases away\" thanks to vaccination, Offit said. , \"We don\'t die from smallpox anymore. Children aren\'t permanently paralyzed by polio anymore in the United States. It\'s a good thing. That\'s because God gave us a brain to think and reason with. So use it.\" , Opinion: Covid-19 vaccines are an answered prayer for all faiths, \'I might not be able to afford a vaccine\', \"It\'s all free. The government is paying for this,\" Offit said., This is one message public officials could do a better job explaining, he said., \"I never hear them described as free, I think because it\'s always assumed that people know they\'re free,\" Offit said. , But \"maybe for all those commercials you see on TV ... they should make it clear you don\'t have to pay this.\", For those who might lack internet access, Offit said it\'d be a good idea for state or local health departments to send flyers in the mail explaining when and how people can get vaccinated -- and reminding them it\'s free. , The bottom line: Not getting vaccinated could set everyone back, If you want to protect yourself, your friends, your family and the economy, get vaccinated. Otherwise, you\'ll be part of the problem -- not the solution. , \"This virus is continuing to mutate,\" Offit said. \"The thing I\'m most worried about is that this virus will mutate to the point that immunity induced by natural infection or vaccination doesn\'t work at all. That\'s the most important reason to vaccinate.\", The longer a virus circulates among unvaccinated people, the more opportunities it has to mutate. And if the mutations are significant, they can lead to more problematic variants -- including some that could partially or fully escape vaccine protection., \"It\'s already starting to happen,\" Offit said, citing the B.1.351 and P.1 variants. While vaccines are still effective against those strains, \"these variants have now started to escape from the immunity of natural infection or immunization. They don\'t completely escape, but they\'ve started to escape.\" , So the key to ending this pandemic isn\'t just getting vaccinated. It\'s getting vaccinated as soon as possible, before the virus mutates into variants that we can\'t control with our current vaccines., \"The vaccine is the most important pathway to ending this pandemic. That means we\'ve got to get everyone in our country vaccinated,\" US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said., \"Now what we\'ve got to do is, No. 1: Get the vaccine. No. 2: Turn around and look at our family and friends and ask if they\'re going to get vaccinated. If they need help, that\'s what we\'ve got to do.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/19/health/covid-vaccine-myths-debunked/index.html',1,94),(71,'Covid-19 breakthrough infections are preventable, but it\'s going to take a big effort to stop them','As Covid-19 case numbers overall are on the rise again across the United States, breakthrough infections, while rare, are making headlines.  Florida Rep. Vern Buchanan tested positive for Covid-19 after vaccination, according to a statement from his office Monday. Fully vaccinated entertainment journalist Catt Sadler warned her hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers not to \"let your guard down,\" after she got sick after caring for someone with Covid-19 who wasn\'t vaccinated. Last Thursday, six players on the New York Yankees tested positive. This was the second instance of breakthrough cases on the team. , , Breakthrough cases are also already cropping up in the Tokyo Summer Olympics.  An alternate member of the US Olympics gymnastics team, Kara Eaker, who had been vaccinated tested positive for Covid-19 Sunday, her father confirmed to CNN affiliate KMBC Monday. So had basketball player Katie Lou Samuelson who confirmed on her Instagram account that she would not be able to compete in Tokyo.  , The good news is that the number of breakthrough infections can be reduced, but it will take a much bigger community effort to protect people from getting Covid-19. ,  A breakthrough infection by definition, Someone with a breakthrough infection has tested positive for the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 at least 14 days after they have been fully vaccinated according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. , For the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine full vaccination is after two doses. For the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine it\'s a single dose. , Breakthrough infections can cause disease with symptoms, and some people can have no symptoms at all. Research has shown that if people become infected after vaccination, typically they get a milder case., No vaccine is perfect, Covid-19 vaccines are highly protective against lab confirmed infection and seem to provide protection against the variants; however, a tiny fraction still become infected, just like they can with any other vaccine. , \"There is no such thing as a vaccine that\'s 100% effective,\" said Dr. Amy Edwards, the associate medical director of Pediatric Infection Control at UH Rainbow Babies and Children\'s Hospital in Cleveland. , , With other diseases like mumps or rubella, breakthrough infections are highly rare, Edwards said, because so many people have been vaccinated against those diseases, and mumps and rubella are in low circulation. , \"The chance that a person who happened to be a nonresponder to the vaccine would come in contact with those diseases is very low,\" said Edwards. \"The reason why we are seeing more breakthrough infections with Covid is because there are so many unvaccinated people.\" , , Another example is the flu vaccine, which reduces the risk of getting sick between 40-60%, studies show. The Covid-19 vaccines are much more protective -- as much as 95% effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and deaths. , , Breakthrough infections by the numbers, We don\'t know how many mild or asymtomatic breakthrough Covid-19 infections there are in the US. The CDC stopped counting in May. , The CDC still counts hospitalizations and deaths from breakthrough infections. The agency said it made this transition to \"help maximize the quality of the data collected on cases of greatest clinical and public health importance.\",  , As of July 12, there have been 5,492 patients with Covid-19 vaccine breakthrough infections who have been hospitalized or died, according to the CDC. This is a small number among the more than 159 million people that have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19., , It\'s hard to draw any specific conclusions about the rate of infection from these numbers, but they are likely an undercount, according to the CDC. Surveillance data relies on voluntary reporting, and not all reporting is complete or even representative of total infections. , What scientists do know is that 99.5% of deaths from Covid-19 in the US right now are among people who are not vaccinated, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN\'s Dana Bash Sunday. , The CDC is monitoring breakthrough infections to identify which people are most likely to have breakthrough infections. The CDC said there are no unusual patterns so far. , Who may be more vulnerable to breakthrough infections, It\'s not totally clear yet. A study of breakthrough infections that caused hospitalization in Israel though found that 6% of the 152 people it studied had no underlying health conditions., On Friday, the CDC warned that vaccines may not protect people who are immunocompromised., People with weakened immune systems are those who have had an organ transplant, are receiving chemotherapy for cancer, are on dialysis or are taking certain medicine that suppresses the immune system.  , , Generally, older people may be more vulnerable to a breakthrough infection, since studies show the immune system declines with age. A preprint, non-peer reviewed, study in England found that older adults were at greater risk of a breakthrough infection. Those Covid-19 cases were typically much milder than they were in the unvaccinated., People who live in parts of the country with low vaccination rates may also have a greater likelihood of a breakthrough infection since they would be encountering more people with the disease., What can you do to prevent a breakthrough infection, \"If we want breakthrough cases to stop, then we need to have everybody else get vaccinated, so there\'s no virus in circulation and then it won\'t matter anymore,\" Edwards said., Nationally, less than 50% of the US has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to the CDC. , If more people are vaccinated, the coronavirus has fewer people it can infect. It also limits the number of new variants that can develop. More variants in circulation increase the likelihood that the coronavirus can evade the protection of the vaccines.  , , \"If you are not vaccinated, you remain at risk,\" said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Friday. \"This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.\" , When asked if people who are vaccinated should be doing anything different than they normally would on Sunday, Murthy told CNN that even with a breakthrough infection \"which, again, happens in a very small minority of people -- it\'s likely to be a mild or asymptomatic infection.\" He did say he would wear a mask indoors out of an abundance of caution if he is in an area with a large number of unvaccinated people. , , , \"Again, even if the vaccine isn\'t offering full protection it is offering a lot of protection,\" Edwards said. \"Even when they do not work as well in patients who are immunocompromised, they do provide some protection. That\'s why it\'s up to the rest of us to get vaccinated because we want to protect those people, the fragile and the elderly, and everyone else.\" , \"So please, I cannot say this enough,\" Edwards said \"Get vaccinated.\" ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/19/health/covid-19-breakthrough-infections-who-gets-and-how-to-stop-them/index.html',1,95),(72,'What vaccinated people should know about Covid-19 exposure, tests and more','Being fully vaccinated against coronavirus comes with a certain degree of exciting freedom. It can also trigger a new set of mental gymnastics when you\'re experiencing possible Covid-19 symptoms or exposed to the virus. So far, the coronavirus vaccines available in the United States provide strong protection against coronavirus, including the Delta variant that now dominates in the US. As of right now, there isn\'t evidence that immunity is beginning to wear off among people who got Covid-19 vaccines in December or January, or that they\'re at higher risk for breakthrough infections, Dr. Jay Butler, the deputy director for infectious diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a briefing Tuesday., Breakthrough infections, or cases among fully vaccinated people, are rare: Out of 157 million people vaccinated by July 6, only 5,186 hospitalized or fatal breakthrough cases have been reported to the CDC, and more than 1,500 of those were asymptomatic, or the hospitalization or death was not related to Covid-19. The CDC notes this is likely an undercount of actual breakthrough cases., And for the fully vaccinated, the CDC guidance around testing, quarantine and isolation after exposure to someone with Covid-19 is different., \"What they are saying is that if you\'re fully vaccinated, the chance of you becoming infected with (coronavirus) is much lower, and the chance of you being an asymptomatic carrier is also much reduced, because even if you were to be infected, you\'re carrying much less virus and therefore are less able to pass it on to others,\" said CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health., \"The issue, though, is with the Delta variant,\" Wen added. \"The Delta variant seems to be present in larger quantities in infected (unvaccinated) people.\" , What\'s not yet fully known is how much the Delta variant could affect the transmission-blocking capacity of the coronavirus vaccines, said Dr. Albert Ko, the chair of and a professor in the department of epidemiology and microbial diseases at the Yale School of Public Health. , If you\'re fully vaccinated but were exposed to Covid-19 or are experiencing related symptoms, here\'s what you should consider in regard to monitoring symptoms, testing, quarantining and more., When vaccinated people should get tested , Fully vaccinated people who are exposed to Covid-19 and asymptomatic -- not experiencing symptoms -- can refrain from getting a coronavirus test and quarantining since their risk of infection is low, with some exceptions for specific settings, the CDC advised as of May 28. Exceptions include those who work in health care, a correctional facility or homeless shelter., If an asymptomatic fully vaccinated person has a known or suspected exposure to Covid-19 but doesn\'t get tested, they should still watch for symptoms in the two weeks after., But testing is widely available and generally easy to access. In contrast to the CDC\'s guidance, Wen advises vaccinated people who spend extended periods of time around an infected, symptomatic person to get tested and quarantine for seven days before getting another test if the first test was negative. , \"The CDC guidance, at the moment, lacks nuance -- as in, there is a difference between if you have a passing interaction with a colleague at work who then turns out to have Covid versus if you are living at home and caring for somebody who has Covid. That\'s just very different,\" Wen said. \"Even if people are not symptomatic but they have prolonged, close contact with somebody, it is prudent for them to quarantine and be tested, too.\" , Wen encourages vaccinated people to carefully consider any interactions they might have after being exposed to someone who has Covid-19., \"I think we need to use some common sense here. I don\'t want someone coming into work, who then tells me that they just spent the entire night caring for their spouse who\'s ill from Covid,\" Wen added. \"Should that person really be in a crowded conference room with a whole bunch of other people? Does that sound right? It doesn\'t meet the common sense test.\", For the vaccinated or unvaccinated, symptoms should trigger a test, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said on CNN\'s New Day on Tuesday. , \"We have seen that many people are actually not getting tested around the country, even though they have symptoms,\" Murthy told CNN\'s Brianna Keiler. \"Many people are thinking, \'Oh Covid\'s over. Why do I really need to get tested?\' and this is particularly happening in areas, unfortunately, where the vaccination rates are low, which is exactly where we want to be testing more.\", Fully vaccinated people in the US don\'t need to get a coronavirus test or quarantine before or after domestic travel, unless required by the local authorities of the destination or your residence, according to the CDC. Quarantining and getting tested before international travel aren\'t necessary for vaccinated people unless required by the destination\'s authorities. , But before vaccinated people -- including US citizens -- board a flight from anywhere abroad to the US, they must have a negative coronavirus test result or documentation of recovery from Covid-19, the CDC has said. Alternative documentation includes proof of antibodies or the absence of symptoms, Ko said. The CDC has also recommended that international travelers arriving in the US get a coronavirus test three to five days after travel regardless of their vaccination status. After traveling internationally, vaccinated people don\'t need to quarantine unless they are showing symptoms. , What to do if you\'re vaccinated and test positive , Vaccinated people who have experienced Covid-19 symptoms in the past 10 days, however, should get tested and isolate themselves from others for 10 days if their test is positive, the CDC has recommended. If you continually test negative for coronavirus but are sick with another viral illness, you still shouldn\'t spread it by going to work or other public spaces, Wen said. , While quarantine separates people who were exposed to see if they become sick, isolation separates sick and contagious people from others who aren\'t ill. Covid-19 symptoms include but aren\'t limited to the following, according to the CDC: , Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headaches New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea , If you\'re exposed to Covid-19, asymptomatic and living with people who are unvaccinated or immunocompromised, you should get tested as soon as possible, Wen said. \"Even if that test were negative, I would continue to quarantine from those vulnerable family members for seven days and then get another test,\" she said. , If that test result is negative, you can consider ending your quarantine and just watching for any symptoms for another week, Ko said. , \"The current vaccines certainly are very protective against death and hospitalizations,\" he added, but \"we want to err on the (side of) caution.\" , READ MORE: You asked, we\'re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines, What to expect if you\'re infected, If you develop symptoms from a coronavirus infection, you\'ll be less sick than if you weren\'t vaccinated, Wen said. There may be uncomfortable symptoms, but it\'s not likely to progress to hospitalization, and extremely unlikely to lead to death. US health officials have reiterated that more than 99% of US Covid-19 deaths in June were among unvaccinated people, and with plenty of vaccines available, death from Covid-19 is preventable. , \"If you had not gotten vaccinated, you might have ended up in the hospital,\" Wen added. \"But because you got the vaccine, you have muscle aches and a fever that go away within a few days. I mean, that\'s (a) testament to the power of the vaccine.\", This happens because coronavirus vaccines reduce the viral load an infected person has in their nose, mouth and eyes, Ko said. , \"That\'s important because that viral load is a key determinant in transmitting to other people,\" Ko said. \"Overall, there\'s really good evidence that these vaccines are protective against transmission or have transmission-blocking capacity. The question now here is how effective that is against these new variants like Delta, and how long that will last us for.\" ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/health/covid-vaccinated-people-guidelines-wellness/index.html',1,96),(73,'The Delta variant is so contagious, those unprotected will likely get it, a Trump administration FDA chief says','Millions of Americans are jeopardizing their health, freedom and finances by not getting vaccinated and putting themselves at risk of the most infectious coronavirus strain yet, current and former federal health officials say. \"Most people will either get vaccinated, or have been previously infected, or they will get this Delta variant,\" Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CBS\' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday., \"And for most people who get this Delta variant, it\'s going to be the most serious virus that they get in their lifetime in terms of the risk of putting them in the hospital,\" said Gottlieb, who was commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration during the Trump administration., For those not fully vaccinated, \"quality of mask is going to make a difference with a variant that spreads more aggressively, like Delta does, where people are more contagious and exude more virus,\" he said., In research posted online, scientists examining 62 cases of the Delta variant found viral loads about 1,260 times higher than those found from 63 cases from the early epidemic wave in 2020., The Delta variant is also sending younger and previously healthy people to hospitals -- the vast majority of which have not been vaccinated, say doctors in several states suffering surges., \"This year\'s virus is not last year\'s virus,\" said Dr. Catherine O\'Neal, an infectious disease specialist at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana., \"It\'s attacking our 40-year-olds. It\'s attacking our parents and young grandparents. And it\'s getting our kids,\" O\'Neal said. She said her Covid-19 unit now has more patients in their 20s who were previously healthy., \"You have to get vaccinated,\" O\'Neal said. \"That\'s the only way to end it. Masks and mitigation, they\'re not going to take it. It\'s going to be vaccination.\"  , Since February, 97% of cases and deaths related to Covid-19 in Louisiana were among people not fully vaccinated, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Friday. , Like with any vaccine, a small percentage of vaccinated people may get a breakthrough infection. But it\'s literally impossible to get Covid-19 from any of the vaccines used in the US because none of them have any coronavirus in them., \"Even if you do have a breakthrough infection -- which, again, happens in a very small minority of people -- it\'s likely to be a mild or asymptomatic infection,\" US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN on Sunday. , But most Americans are not fully vaccinated. As of Sunday, only 48.6% of Americans were fully vaccinated, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., Many Americans have not been vaccinated due to misinformation, which \"takes away our freedom and our power to make (educated) decisions for us and our families,\" the surgeon general said. , Now, infections of the Delta variant have spread to all 50 states. , In Los Angeles County, the rate of new Covid-19 cases has increased 300% since July 4, the county health department said. Covid-19 hospitalizations have more than doubled from the previous month. , The surge in new Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations prompted county officials to reinstate an indoor mask mandate. , \'She was in the best shape of her life,\' then died from Covid-19, Rachel Maginn Rosser recently lost her 63-year-old mother to Covid-19. Rosser, a nurse, said she believes her mom would still be alive had she been vaccinated. , \"She was in the best shape of her life. She was working out five times a week with a personal trainer,\" Rossner said Saturday. \"She loved to go out and have fun. She was a social butterfly. And she got sick, and it was just a slow decline from there.\" , Kim Maginn had a sore throat and fever for about a week, said her daughter Rosser, who lives in Arkansas. Maginn was \"shocked\" when she went to the doctor last month and found out it wasn\'t strep, but Covid-19., Arkansas has one of the lowest vaccinations rates in the country, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., And with Covid-19 patients filling up hospital beds, Rosser said she felt \"helpless\" because she wasn\'t able to visit her mother when she was in an intensive care unit., \"I had to stay outside of her room and call her on her cell phone to talk to her,\" she said. \"She looked really small in the bed. It was hard for her to talk because she was struggling to breathe.\", Rosser said her mother didn\'t get vaccinated because she believed that since she hadn\'t already been infected, she wasn\'t going to get sick., She said she pleaded for her mom to get vaccinated. , \"I tried several different tactics. I laid all the facts out for her. I tried to plead to her emotional side of \'What would we do without you? Could you imagine our life without you?\'\" Rosser said.  , \"Part of me wishes I had tried harder. But she was really stubborn. She was stubborn, but she wasn\'t stupid. I think eventually I would have been able to convince her, but she got sick and she got Covid. And so there wasn\'t any more time to try and convince her.\" , Rosser said she hopes sharing her family\'s story will help encourage others who are vaccine hesitant to get vaccinated., \"This virus ... doesn\'t discriminate. It doesn\'t care if you\'re old or you\'re young, or you\'re healthy or you\'re not. Once you get it, it can be devastating to your family,\" Rosser said., She encouraged people to \"keep talking to their loved ones and keep trying to convince them because I wouldn\'t want anybody else to have to go through this.\", Coronavirus has spread among children at camps, While the chances of children dying from Covid-19 are low,  more children and teens are getting hospitalized with Covid-19 or suffering long-term complications., There have been numerous instances of Covid-19 outbreaks at summer camps., In Utah, officials are investigating Covid-19 cases at more than a dozen summer camps for children, said Aislynn Tolman-Hill, a spokesperson for Utah County\'s health department. , \"We are hearing and know that there are MANY instances where symptomatic campers are sent home but not getting tested,\" Tolman-Hill told CNN in an email. , \"This is obviously a huge concern. If we are not made aware of these situations, we cannot do contact tracing and notification of those exposed.\", Local health records in Utah County showed less than 30% of children 12-18 are fully vaccinated. State law prohibits the Utah County Health Department from requiring camps to follow any coronavirus rules or procedures, Tolman-Hill said. , \"All we can do is educate and advocate,\" she said., In North Carolina, three out-of-state campers at Camp Daniel Boone Scout Camp in Haywood County tested positive for coronavirus, local health officials said., The camp canceled its remaining sessions and notified health officials when the trio tested positive on July 14, according to a statement from Daniel Boone Council, Boy Scouts of America. The camp also informed everyone who attended camp during that time of their potential exposure., The camp had been following its \"COVID-19 Mitigation Plan,\" which was approved by county health officials, the statement said. Mitigation measures included a pre-event medical screening checklist, daily temperature checks, social distancing, a mask requirement for indoor and group settings and handwashing and sanitizing stations throughout the camp., \"These events bring to light that Covid-19 is still prevalent in our community,\" Haywood County Public Health Director Sarah Henderson said. , \"It is not gone, and this is not over.

Yet even outside of a pandemic — with its staggering losses of lives, homes, economic security and normalcy — grief is hard work.\"The funny thing about grief is that no one ever feels like they\'re doing it the right way,\" said therapist Claire Bidwell Smith, author of \"Anxiety: The Missing Stage of Grief.\" But there is no right way, she insisted. The only \"wrong\" way is to not do it., , What often trips people up is misattributing the sensations of grief-related anxiety to some unrelated cause. \"Probably 70% of my clients have gone into the hospital for a panic attack following a big loss,\" Smith said. , After doctors rule out physical illness, clients come to her for counseling, frequently struggling to understand the link between their physical symptoms and bereavement. , This becomes especially problematic in grief-averse places like the United States, Smith explained.,  , With over 4 million reported Covid-19 deaths reported worldwide since December 2019, grief and loss have touched an untold number of hearts and minds. Smith recommends connecting the dots between loss and anxiety as a critical first step toward healing., This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity., CNN: How are grief and anxiety related?, Claire Bidwell Smith: When some big change comes seemingly out of nowhere and disrupts life, we realize we\'re not safe, things aren\'t certain, we\'re not in control. , All of that is true all of the time, but loss is a huge reminder. The life changes and emotional upheaval are so much bigger than most people understand. Grief, which is the series of emotions that accompany a significant loss, can drop you to your knees. That feeds anxiety., , Grieving people can begin feeling anxious about their own health or the safety of other loved ones. Sometimes, they don\'t even realize what they are experiencing is anxiety or is in any way related to their grief., Anxiety, a psychological condition that causes fear and worry, can present with many physical symptoms. These can be misleading, making you think you have heart palpitations, a stomach issue, a new sweating problem, headaches, insomnia. Many people think they have a medical problem and not an emotional one., CNN: How do you help people ease their grief-related anxiety?, Smith: My first job is to help people connect the dots between their loss and their fears by tracing their anxiety on a time line: When was I last anxious? How were things before my loved one died? , If the loved one had a long illness, the anxiety might begin before the death. After a sudden death, the anxiety might start right away. Usually if someone\'s going to veer into anxious territory, it\'s something that happens quickly following loss., Some people I see, who have never had anxiety in their lives, suddenly begin to have panic attacks right after the death of a loved one. Others, long familiar with anxiety, see symptoms really ratchet up after a loss, or maybe take on new manifestations. , CNN: What coping strategies can people use?, Smith: Seeking out support is really vital. There are so many more support groups and grief therapists available right now. And because of the pandemic, many are available virtually. You can often find support online and start tomorrow. If the therapists or groups you find are booked, get on a wait list. It\'s never too late to work through your grief., If people don\'t seek out help to untangle their emotions, they get stuck in anger or guilt. Those play out in substance abuse, depression and anxiety, in relationship issues and in trouble at work and school. So, the domino effect of trying to muscle through and not seeking out support isn\'t good., CNN: What advice do you have for those resistant to formal mental health treatment? , Smith: Self-guided online courses are one option that many therapists provide. Even reading articles or books or listening to a podcast about grief can normalize your experience and help you give you more permission to mourn. You can feel like you\'re going crazy, like something else is wrong with you, when really, it\'s grief. , Social media offers so many grief resources. A simple search on Instagram for #grief can help you find solidarity with others. Even just reading about other people\'s experiences through their posts and comments is valuable because it can help you realize you\'re not alone., CNN: Because of the pandemic, so many people have been unable to be with their dying loved ones. What impact might that have?, Smith: We will see more complicated grief, with extended periods of grieving where people may get stuck in a loop of guilt or regret or anger. That comes, in part, from the feeling that a lot of the losses were preventable, and because people were forced to say goodbye to loved ones over Zoom and FaceTime with nurses wearing masks and face shields. Those kinds of endings can lend themselves to complicated grief. , , Clients I\'m working with who have lost a loved one to Covid-19 are feeling anger as they watch people get vaccinated — or choose not to get vaccinated. Everyone\'s posting reunion pictures. Someone who lost a parent to Covid a month ago is painfully aware of just how close they were to not having to go through this loss. , Initially, they have to work through shock, anger and guilt. Then we can begin to find new ways to say goodbye. That can look like doing self-compassion exercises or speaking with a pastor, minister or rabbi to work on absolution of guilt. It can involve finding spiritual connections to someone they have lost by writing them letters. I urge people to embrace their own sense of ritual and perhaps even hold memorials., CNN: What role do meditation and mindfulness play in healing?, Smith: When we are grieving, and when we are anxious, we spend a lot of time dwelling in the past and fretting about the future. Meditation and mindfulness help bring our awareness to the present moment. , Meditation also helps us to understand our own thoughts, and how we can learn to detach from negative ideas and irrational fears., CNN: You write that imagination can be another powerful tool. How?, Smith: I wasn\'t there the night my mother died. Even today, I imagine myself crawling into her hospital bed and holding her and saying the goodbye that I didn\'t get to. I\'ve found catharsis in envisioning what I would have done, had I been able. But it took me years — definitely more than five — to get to that point. , Just like when athletes envision a course the night before, imagination can almost give your body a sense memory, which can be soothing. But it\'s not something that people are ready to do right away., CNN: What role does story play in coping with grief and loss?, Smith: People carry around stories of loss and death, but they often feel like they are suppressing them because they haven\'t found good places to share them. How we hold a story is very indicative of how we feel emotionally. When we are holding a scary story, an uncomfortable story, a story of regret for a long time, it plays out in our day-to-day life., Healing comes from finding outlets to explore a story and possibly find ways to reframe it. We can do that in therapy, counseling, support groups, online grief forums and grief writing classes, among other places. , CNN: You\'ve come to believe that staying connected with our lost loved ones can be more healing than letting go. What does that look like? , Smith: That looks different for everyone, and it isn\'t something most of us can do right away — we often just want our person back in front of us.

Now, I feel it\'s more important to move forward with the person you have lost. , , For example, pondering: What advice would my dad give me about this job offer? What would my mom think of my new boyfriend?, Developing and fostering a relationship with our person can include sharing stories about them, taking on certain aspects of work they did or doing things in remembrance. , CNN: You quote Hope Edelman, author of \"The AfterGrief,\" who has said the crux of grief work is making meaning out of loss. Is there a way to foster the meaning-making that can have such lasting value? , Smith: In some ways, that stage comes naturally. However, we can\'t get there until we work through guilt, regret and anger that stand in the way of our ability to make meaning. If we\'re angry with our loved one or a situation that happened, a lot of people will hold onto that anger because it\'s a very powerful emotion. , , But I\'ve never seen a grieving client who hasn\'t questioned life in a new way. Where\'s my person? Can they see me? Will I ever see them again? Why am I still here? , It\'s really hard to go through huge loss and not have those questions.

But before you slather that product on your skin, first check to see if it is part of a The companies recently pulled several sunscreens from market shelves after independent testing had found they were contaminated with a cancer-causing chemical called benzene. , \"Exposure to benzene increases the risk of developing leukemia and other blood disorders,\" according to the National Cancer Institute.  , CVS Health also stopped selling two of its after-sun care products due to similar findings. But other sunscreens and after-sun cosmetics, which also tested positive for the toxin, remain on the market (the full list is below)., The vast majority of tested sunscreens, however, were free of benzene, and experts stress the importance of sunscreen use to protect skin from the aging and cancerous effects of the sun., \"It is NOT a reason to stop using sun protection, which is known to prevent skin cancer. To do so would be like hearing a particular car model was recalled and then committing to never drive again,\" dermatologist Dr. Ranella Hirsch, a past president of the American Society of Cosmetic Dermatology and Aesthetic Surgery, posted on Instagram., How did brand-name sunscreens become contaminated with benzene? Should you be concerned? And what can you do to protect yourself and your family? We\'ve gathered answers to these questions and more., Which sunscreens were recalled?, All batches, or lots, of these four Neutrogena spray sunscreens and one Aveeno spray were voluntarily recalled this week by parent company Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) \"out of an abundance of caution\":, Neutrogena® Beach Defense® aerosol Neutrogena® Cool Dry Sport aerosol Neutrogena® Invisible Daily™ defense aerosol Neutrogena® Ultra Sheer® aerosol Aveeno® Protect + Refresh aerosol , \"While benzene is not an ingredient in any of our sunscreen products, it was detected in some samples of the impacted aerosol sunscreen finished products,\" J&amp;J reported in a statement. \"Consumers should stop using these specific products and appropriately discard them.\", Specific lots of all recalled Neutrogena and Aveeno sunscreens can be found here, and customers can call with questions and request a refund by completing this form, or calling 1-800-458-1673., CVS also stopped selling CVS Health After Sun Aloe Vera and CVS Health After Sun Aloe Vera Spray a day after the Johnson &amp; Johnson recall was announced.  , Mike DeAngelis, senior director of CVS Health\'s corporate communications, told CNN the company is \"cooperating with Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s voluntary recall.\" , He said that \"CVS products have not been recalled,\" but the company has paused sales of the two CVS products, which tested positive for benzene, \"out of an abundance of caution.\" CVS Health is working with the supplier of the products to \"take appropriate additional steps,\" he added., However, one of the CVS products on the list of benzene-contaminated products, After-sun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel, \"is still for sale,\" DeAngelis said., Why were the sunscreens recalled?, The voluntary recalls and pause in sales came after an independent lab tested 294 samples from 69 brands of sprays, lotions, gels and creams designed to protect the skin from the sun or care for the skin after sun. Of those, 78 samples tested positive for benzene., Contamination appeared in specific batches of sunscreen, rather than a specific brand, said David Light, CEO and founder of Valisure, the independent lab that ran the tests., \"The finding of benzene in sunscreen was certainly surprising to me as a scientist and a consumer. I\'m quite a heavy user of sunscreen myself; I have five kids and we all use sunscreen, so it was rather concerning to find such high levels,\" Light said., Multiple samples contained \"significantly detectable benzene and some batches contained up to 3.1 times the conditionally restricted limit,\" according to the citizen petition asking for action that Valisure filed with the US Food and Drug Administration., \"We petitioned the FDA to recall or to request recalls of the products that are 0.1 per million and above,\" Light told CNN. \"It\'s obvious that we shouldn\'t be taking that risk, and we just wanted it cleaned up.\" , Samples of three of the recalled Neutrogena spray sunscreens -- Beach Defense, Invisible Daily and Ultra Sheer -- and one CVS brand -- After-sun Aloe Vera Soothing Spray -- had levels of benzene that were 2 parts per million or higher, according to Valisure\'s tests. , Another spray, Neutrogena\'s Cool Dry Sport, and CVS Health\'s After-sun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel, tested at .01 to 2 parts per million of benzene in some samples. , Aveeno\'s Protect + Refresh aerosol, which was the fifth sunscreen recalled by J&amp;J, was not tested by Valisure., \"We did not have the chance of acquiring any of the Aveeno sprays, but it certainly sounds like Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s own internal testing confirms our overall concern with benzene in the sunscreens,\" Light said., According to J&amp;J, daily exposure to benzene in these sunscreen products \"at the levels detected in internal testing would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences.\", \"There is not a safe level of benzene that can exist in sunscreen products,\" said Dr. Christopher Bunick, associate professor of dermatology at Yale University, in Valisure\'s press release. \"Even benzene at 0.1 ppm (parts per million) in a sunscreen could expose people to excessively high nanogram amounts of benzene.\", Which products were not recalled?, Samples of Eco Formula Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30, Advanced After-Sun Gel by Sun Burst, Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 by SunBurnt, Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 by Goodsense, Ultimate Sheer Sunscreen Lotion SPF 70 by TopCare Everyday, and UV Aero Broad-Spectrum Full-Body Sunscreen Spray, SPF 45 by EltaMD all tested for benzene at levels of 2 parts per million or higher., Samples of three Banana Boat products also contained levels of benzene at those levels: Kids Max Protect &amp; Play Sunscreen C-Spray SPF 100, UltraMist Deep Tanning Dry Oil Continuous Clear Spray SPF 4 and Ultra Sport Clear Sunscreen Spray SPF 100., To date, CNN was not able to verify that any of these products have been recalled following Valisure\'s request to that effect to the FDA., The sunscreens tested by Valisure were only a tiny sample of the more than 11,000 registered sun care products on the market., The Personal Care Products Council, an industry association, said its members were \"firmly committed\" to providing products with \"ingredients that have been thoroughly tested for safety and follow the requirements of the law.\", \"We are aware of the study reporting the presence of benzene in some of the sunscreen products tested,\" the council said in a statement. \"There is nothing more important than safety. If our consumers can\'t believe in a product or rely on it to do what it says, then nothing else matters.\", What is benzene?, Benzene is a natural component of crude oil, gasoline and cigarette smoke and ranks in the top 20 chemicals used for production of \"lubricants, rubbers, dyes, detergents, drugs, and pesticides,\" as well as \"plastics, resins, and nylon and synthetic fibers,\" according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., At room temperature, benzene is a colorless or light yellow liquid with a sweet odor. Highly flammable, it will float on water, and while it evaporates quickly, it is heavier than air and can sink into low-lying areas, the CDC noted., Gas emissions from volcanoes and forest fires are natural sources of benzene, but the largest sources are emissions from burning coal and oil, motor vehicle exhaust, and evaporation from gasoline service stations, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)., Exposure to high levels of benzene in the air can cause death, the ATSDR says, but the impacts of eating foods or drinking liquids containing lower levels of benzene are not known. , \"If you spill benzene on your skin, it may cause redness and sores. Benzene in your eyes may cause general irritation and damage to your cornea,\" the ATSDR said., Cigarette smoke and off-gassing from furniture wax, detergents, glue and paint are sources of indoor exposure to benzene, according to the CDC, while outdoor air can be polluted with benzene from \"gas stations, motor vehicle exhaust, and industrial emissions.\", How did benzene get into sunscreens?, No one knows for sure how the toxin ended up in sun care products. Benzene was not an ingredient in any of the sunscreens, so experts suspect contamination had to have occurred during the manufacturing process., \"There are a lot of theories,\" said Scott Faber, the senior vice president of government affairs for the Environmental Working Group (EWG), a non-profit consumer health advocacy group which puts out a yearly guide to safe sunscreens. , \"Benzene could be a byproduct of the process of making the chemicals that companies sell to the formulators of personal care products and sunscreens. Or it could be that some of those chemicals break down into benzene, although that seems less likely,\" Faber said. , \"But it\'s very alarming, especially since the FDA does not require companies to test ingredients for contaminants, nor does it require testing for such chemicals at a finished product stage,\" he added. , What is the FDA doing?, In response to Valisure\'s petition, the FDA told CNN that it \"evaluates and assesses the information provided in citizen petitions of this type and, generally, initiates an independent testing and verification process.\", \"While the FDA evaluates the citizen petition submitted by Valisure, we will continue to monitor sunscreen manufacturing and marketing to help ensure the availability of safe sunscreens for U.S. consumers,\" an FDA spokesperson said., How can I tell if my sunscreen is contaminated?, Because the contamination was sporadic and likely occurred accidentally, there is no way for consumers to look at a label and choose a product without benzene, Faber said. , \"Sadly, consumers are screwed. There\'s no way to shop around this problem,\" Faber said, adding that consumers can petition for new regulations to more thoroughly test consumer care products for toxins and contaminants., \"People can tell the FDA to require over-the-counter sunscreen product companies to test for contaminants like benzene, and people can tell Congress to pass laws to modernize cosmetics safety laws,\" he said., Valisure has committed to testing additional sun care products as they have space in their lab schedules, and it is encouraging people to send in sunscreens and sun care products they have purchased to be analyzed. , If you\'re interested in having your sunscreen tested in their crowdsourcing study, the full instructions on how to package and send your product can be found here., How can I protect my family?, Benzene is not the only concern when it comes to sunscreen. A number of sunscreens have been shown to be ineffective or contain chemicals that can enter the bloodstream and disrupt hormones. In EWG\'s 2021 guide to sunscreens, they analyzed over 1,800 products and found that 75% did not provide adequate sun protection -- or included ingredients linked to harm. Still, there were over 200 products that did meet their safety standards., All of this uncertainty may leave consumers unsure of what to do, and experts worry some may forgo the use of sunscreen altogether. But, experts warned, that\'s an even worse idea. Melanoma, one of the most deadly forms of skin cancer, has been on the rise globally for decades. And while survival rates are getting better, melanoma is still the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States., And of course, it\'s always a great choice to use common sense practices as well to protect your skin from harmful rays. Wear shorts, shirts, pants and hats to help block dangerous rays and apply safe sunscreens to exposed skin. Wisely choose your time in the sun by avoiding the most intense rays between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and seek shade whenever possible.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/17/health/sunscreen-recall-cancer-wellness/index.html',1,101),(77,'Covid-19 vaccines are effective at preventing severe disease, experts say, as rising cases threaten unvaccinated','With Speaking to CNN\'s Jim Acosta on Saturday, Dr. Anthony Fauci said the vaccines are shown to be \"highly effective in preventing symptomatic, clinically apparent disease.\", \"When you start seeing what\'s called breakthrough infections, if you look carefully at them, the overwhelming majority of those are people who either have no symptoms or only very mild symptoms,\" Fauci said. \"So the vaccines are still very, very effective in preventing severe disease.\" , The Delta variant has \"pretty much taken over\" in the US, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\'s Hospital in Philadelphia and a member of the US Food and Drug Administration\'s vaccine advisory committee. But it\'s clear the vaccines work against the Delta variant, too, he said., \"Despite the rise of the Delta variant, still 97% of people who are hospitalized or killed by this virus are unvaccinated,\" Offit said. \"If the Delta variant were escaping, essentially, immunity induced by vaccination, then you should have seen a rise in people who are vaccinated, but nonetheless were still hospitalized and killed. And that hasn\'t happened.\" , Yet the pace of inoculations is slowing, with less than half of the US population -- 48.5%, per the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- fully vaccinated. And it\'s the communities with lower vaccination rates that are at risk. , Among those states that have fully vaccinated less than half of their residents, the average Covid-19 case rate was 11 new cases per 100,000 people last week, compared to 4 per 100,000 among states that have fully vaccinated more than half of their residents, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University., \"If you are unvaccinated, the risk is incredibly high -- and maybe in some areas higher than it\'s ever been,\" said Dr. Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at Columbia University Medical Center, adding people are acting a \"little more carefree and lackadaisical,\" raising the chance of exposure. , Indeed, the number of people traveling by air set a pandemic-era record Friday, with nearly 2.2 million people screened at US airports, a spokesperson for the Transportation Security Administration said, adding an admonition: \"#MaskUp.\", In the meantime, vaccinated people should \"continue to be smart,\" but are very unlikely to get sick, be hospitalized or die of Covid-19, Spencer said., Vaccine efforts turn to young people, Canada and the US were neck and neck early Saturday afternoon in the percentage of fully vaccinated people, according to data from the countries\' governments. So far, 18,286,671 Canadians, or 48.65%, have been fully vaccinated, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, compared with 160,994,035, or 48.5%, of Americans, according to the CDC data., In the US, officials are increasingly focused on increasing vaccination rates among younger people. , \"Young people sometimes ... feel that they\'re invulnerable. They need a little, I would say a gentle push -- not forcing or threatening, but to get them to understand why it\'s important for their own safety,\" Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Saturday. \"Because as we\'re getting more and more infections with the Delta variant ... we\'re seeing more and more young people who are getting seriously ill.\" , To that end, Fauci teamed up with 18-year-old pop star Olivia Rodrigo this week, appearing in a video released by the White House that encourages young people to get vaccinated. , \"The sooner all of us get vaccinated, the sooner we can, like, hang out with our friends and sing songs and all of the fun things,\" Rodrigo said. , Alabama health officials Friday announced a TikTok contest aimed at increasing Covid-19 vaccination rates among people between the ages of 13 and 29. Contestants are asked to submit a video that shows them getting vaccinated and a message that shares why they chose to do so. Four winners will be chosen to receive a $250 Visa gift card, officials said., Darrell Hudson, principal of A.H. Parker High School in Birmingham, Alabama, told CNN school officials don\'t know how many of their students are vaccinated, and \"some are still a little concerned about taking the vaccine and what\'s in the vaccine.\" But he said he\'s hopeful students will get the shot, along with their families, so they can safely return to the classroom August 2. , \"We don\'t want any child coming to our campus, taking the virus back home to parents, to grandparents, to aunties and to their relatives,\" Hudson said., As for vaccines for even younger children, studies continue, Fauci told CNN., \"Thus far, things look good, but the final decision is going to be up to the FDA,\" Fauci said. \"And I would imagine that likely will not happen until we get well into the winter, towards the end of this year.\" , Additionally, Fauci said he \"would be astounded\" if the Covid-19 vaccine by Pfizer/BioNTech didn\'t receive full FDA approval for people 16 and older by the end of August (each vaccine available in the US has been authorized for emergency use, but they have yet to be fully approved). The companies announced Friday the FDA had granted priority review designation to their application for approval for their vaccine., \"But even between now and then, people should realize that the data of the efficacy and real-world effectiveness of these vaccines is really extraordinary -- not only in the United States, but in multiple countries throughout the world,\" Fauci said., \'I don\'t think we\'ve seen the worst of it\', Local officials continue to sound the alarm about the increase in cases, particularly among those unvaccinated. Twenty states have fully vaccinated more than half of their residents, according to the CDC, but health care facility resources are being stretched in states with fewer vaccinations., Only a fourth of residents in Mobile County, Alabama, are fully vaccinated, Commissioner Merceria Ludgood said at a news conference Friday. And now the county is seeing a massive increase in hospitalizations, according to Dr. Laura Cepeda, chief medical officer of the Mobile County Health Department, who said there\'s been a 400% increase in hospitalizations in the past month. , Mayor Sandy Stimpson encouraged those who have gotten the shots to talk with their loved ones and neighbors. , \"Today, we have sports heroes, we have rock stars, we have movie stars, coaches encouraging people all across this country to get vaccinated,\" Stimpson said. \"But if you\'ve been vaccinated, don\'t underestimate your ability to reach out to someone and encourage them to do it. You may be that person to convince them that this is the right thing to do.\", Katie Towns, acting director of the Springfield-Greene County Health Department in Missouri, told CNN Friday the department is requesting an alternative care site and staff from the state to address the growing number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, saying, \"It\'s at a level that we\'ve not seen before,\", \"Most striking is the demographic and age,\" she said of Covid-19 patients, \"almost all\" of whom are unvaccinated. \"The illness has really shifted from being an older population ... to being ages 20, 30, 40 years old in the hospital and needing ICU care and oxygen.\" , And hospitals and health officials are projecting an increase in numbers following the Fourth of July holiday., \"I don\'t think we\'ve seen the worst of it,\" Towns said. , The return of mask guidelines , But even in areas with higher rates of vaccination, officials are beginning to reinstitute safety protocols such as mask mandates to try to curb the spread. , Health authorities in the San Francisco Bay Area on Friday announced they are recommending everyone wear masks indoors. , And Los Angeles County will reinstate its indoor mask mandate Saturday night for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. The county\'s public health department reported 1,827 new cases Saturday, a fourfold increase in the number of cases reported on July 4. , George Metsos, owner of Patys Restaurant in Los Angeles, told CNN the mask mandates have been confusing, and the changing guidance doesn\'t help. , \"They say follow the science.

I knew my brother was gone.\"Michelle Branch lost her brother, Craig Elazer, on September 1, 2020, to a fentanyl overdose. He had been receiving support for his addiction, which he had struggled with since he was 12, but a changed world due to the coronavirus pandemic ultimately led to his untimely death., Branch\'s loss is one of tens of thousands in 2020. More than 93,000 people died from a drug overdose last year, according to provisional data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s National Center for Health Statistics., This means that 2020 was the deadliest year on record for drug overdoses., \"It\'s terrible news,\" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former deputy commission at the US Food and Drug Administration., \"We\'ve had such a devastating year from the pandemic, and on top of that, a record number of Americans dying of drug overdose.\",  An accidental mix-up leads to tragedy, Elazer\'s struggle with addiction lasted most of his life. He would mainly use alcohol, but he would also use other drugs to self-medicate his anxiety. He had gone in and out of rehabilitation centers, though nothing seemed to stick., Elazer was released from prison \"smack dab in the middle of Covid,\" his sister said, and despite the national trend of job loss, he managed to find work caring for their disabled cousin and find a place to live in the \"terrible part of St. Louis.\", While he had been participating in Alcoholics Anonymous and was doing a two-step program, restrictions limiting in-person gatherings forced support groups online, and funding dried up for other support programs., Elazer was not familiar with how to use current technology to access online support groups, which made getting help nearly impossible for him. He stopped going to AA meetings and eventually slipped back into alcohol and drug abuse., On the night that claimed his life, he most likely thought he had purchased Xanax, his sister said. But what he had purchased -- and ended up using -- was actually fentanyl., After trying and failing to contact Elazer all evening, Branch and her cousin sent her cousin\'s son to find out what had happened. The front door to Elazer\'s apartment had a mail slot where the son could see Elazer\'s legs on the ground, where he lay motionless. He called an ambulance, but it was too late., Branch received a call from their cousin that night saying Elazer was \"gone.\", \"I just couldn\'t comprehend that. And I was like, \'Gone where?\' And she says, \'Shelly, I think he\'s gone.\' \", \'An all-time high to a new all-time high\', Overdose rates have been increasing since 1999, according to the NCHS. In 2019, there were 70,630 deaths, and compared with that year\'s rate, deaths in 2020 increased by almost 30%., \"It\'s a major increase from an all-time high to a new all-time high,\" said Sharfstein. \"And it just reflects so much tragedy, suffering ... and each death is surrounded by a circle of trauma., \"People that cared about that person, their family, their loved ones, their friends. So the impact overall is devastating.\", Sharfstein also cited the Covid-19 pandemic as a reason for overdose deaths spiking in 2020. The pandemic caused a swath of \"grief, trauma, economic and social dislocation,\" he said. People who may have been recovering from an addiction, or had never used drugs at all, might find themselves in dire circumstances. Perhaps they had a loved one pass away, or they may have lost their job. Sharfstein says these risk factors may push someone to use drugs., Track the epidemic in real time, The statistics are grim, but there are measures that can be taken to mitigate the damage., Sharfstein is calling for another comparison to Covid-19, but in this case, a comparison of the urgency and inventiveness of response efforts., He stressed that tracking the problem is an important step in addressing it, and noted that while data collection efforts were robust with \"maps every day, we knew how many new cases, who got the new cases, who\'s getting tested, who\'s getting vaccinated,\" data collection for overdoses hasn\'t been as urgent., \"Here we are in July, and we\'re just getting the data for 2020,\" he said. \"We can do a lot better with data and use that data, just like we did with Covid, to focus our energy on the populations, the groups and the areas that need the most attention.\", Medical treatment strategies that rose to prominence over the course of the pandemic may also be used to address the overdose crisis. For example, telemedicine use skyrocketed over the pandemic, and Sharfstein thinks telemedicine could play an important role in addressing addiction-related health disorders. , Sharfstein thinks cases of overdose deaths may decline as the country moves into a less urgent phase of the pandemic. However, he stresses that any improvement does not mean that the problem has fixed itself, and that current resources are \"not sufficient.\", \"A major priority for 2021 is going to be to follow the evidence to do the same thing we did with Covid,\" he said. \"Use science, use evidence, use compassion, and get the treatments and supports to people who need them.\", For Branch, there is no bringing her brother back.

That\'s a 29.4% increase from the 72,151 deaths projected for 2019., \"Overdose deaths from synthetic opioids (primarily fentanyl) and psychostimulants such as methamphetamine also increased in 2020 compared to 2019.

Some members of Congress have blamed the FDA for approving new synthetic opioids, and makers of some of the drugs -- notably Oxycontin maker Purdue Pharma -- have been prosecuted for their role in marketing them., Last week, members of the Sackler family, who own Purdue, reached a $4.5 billion settlement with 15 states as part of legal actions dissolving the company., Doctors have also been blamed for overprescribing opioids and addicting people to them in the first place., Sharfstein said he thinks the FDA could and should do more to control over-prescribing of opioids., \"There are definitely actions that the clinical community can take to reduce the risk of people becoming addicted to opioids,\" Sharfstein told CNN., \"The FDA oversight of medical and clinical practice is an area the agency acknowledges it needs to improve. The question of whether a particular drug should have been approved or not is fair to ask. But now the emphasis should be on the oversight of prescribing,\" added Sharfstein., \"If you think about how the country has made progress on Covid since there was a clear national strategy that included goals and good data and evidence for critical projects -- I think that kind of approach is important here. The same kind of urgency and strategy that has been applied to Covid could produce results over time.\", Sharfstein was pleased by the announcement Tuesday that President Joe Biden would nominate former West Virginia health commissioner Dr. Rahul Gupta to head the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. If confirmed, Gupta would be the first physician to lead the office., \"Dr, Gupta is experienced at viewing the drug crisis as a health problem.

Goal Date,\" Woodcock tweeted., All three vaccines currently have emergency use authorization from the FDA., In a letter to the New York Times this month, Dr. Peter Marks, director of FDA\'s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, wrote that the review of applications for full approval of the Covid-19 vaccines is \"one of the highest priorities\" at the FDA, but it requires the evaluation of extensive manufacturing and clinical information., \"Any vaccine approval without completion of the high-quality review and evaluation that Americans expect the agency to perform would undermine the F.D.A.\'s statutory responsibilities, affect public trust in the agency and do little to help combat vaccine hesitancy,\" Marks wrote., , He noted that all three Covid-19 vaccines available in the United States have met the standard for emergency use authorization; Pfizer\'s vaccine is authorized for use in people as young as 12., \"If we truly want our lives to return to normal, the fastest way to do so is simple — get vaccinated right now,\" Marks wrote. , Vaccine makers originally applied for emergency use authorization because the process takes less time than what would be required for full approval, but the safety and efficacy of the shots was tested in large trials and has since been confirmed by millions of doses administered since the vaccine rollout began late last year., However, full approval could have an impact on vaccine mandates -- several schools and business have suggested they would consider mandating Covid-19 vaccines once they are approved. It may also help sway skeptics hesitant to get the vaccines now., A Kaiser Family Foundation survey of US adults released this week found that among the one-third of adults surveyed who are not yet vaccinated, 16% said the vaccine was too new, too unknown or not tested enough., US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Friday that approval may encourage some to get vaccinated, but the vaccines have already been administered to millions around the world. , According to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 160 million people -- 48.3% of the US population -- are fully vaccinated against Covid-19., \"For some people the FDA approval process may make a difference, but I do think that we have a fair amount of experience right now, a tremendous amount of experience, that tells us that, again, the benefits of this vaccine far outweigh any risks,\" Murthy said during a Washington Post event.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/16/health/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-fda-priority-review/index.html',1,106),(81,'US is \'losing time\' in vaccination race as Delta variant becomes more pervasive, expert says','\"We\'re losing time here.

Asa Hutchinson to discuss the matter. , Patterson said while hospitals have the ability to add more ICU beds, staffing is an acute issue. Patterson said they \"are close to the limit now.\", Vaccines have been available to most Americans for months, but still only 48.3% of the country is fully vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- and the rate of new vaccinations is on the decline. It was down 11% from a week ago and is less than a quarter of the pace from two months ago., Meanwhile, case rates have been going up dramatically. In 47 states, the rate of new cases in the past week is at least 10% higher than the previous week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. A total of 35 states have seen increases of more than 50%., The numbers speak positively about vaccines, expert says, Officials and experts have said disinformation is largely to blame for the high number of unvaccinated Americans, a group that is seeing the largest impacts of the pandemic. , \"This is not just a matter of people expressing opinions that might be wrong, this is life and death,\" Collins said., Much of the data now shows that more than 99% of people currently hospitalized with Covid-19 are unvaccinated, Collins said. That means those who are vaccinated have enough protection that they aren\'t getting severely ill, Collins said. , And the vaccines are still showing signs of being very effective against the Delta variant, he said, which is one of the greatest concerns for health experts currently. , Collins said he hopes the American public will pay attention to the data and decide that getting vaccinated is the safe and smart thing to do. , \"I hope people will hear this, right now listening to this: If you are on the fence about whether vaccination is going to help you, listen to those numbers,\" Collins said. \"Why are we waiting folks?

The company met with administration and top public health officials this week to discuss the data., \"We don\'t think that boosters are needed at the current time,\" Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said Wednesday. , , \"We will follow the data on waning of immunity over time and the data on acquisition of infections by the vaccinated to see if, at some point, it appears that a booster would be warranted,\" Woodcock said in a conversation hosted by STAT News., The more important conversation at this stage, she said, is getting unvaccinated people vaccinated. , But Collins noted, for some people, an extra dose -- not a booster -- may help get their immune response to a fully vaccinated level., \"People who have immune deficiencies, who did not get a full response to the original pair of doses from Moderna or Pfizer, or the one dose from J&amp;J -- maybe an additional dose might help those people,\" Collins told CNN\'s Erin Burnett, specifically pointing to organ transplant recipients and cancer patients on chemotherapy., \"I wouldn\'t call that a booster, though,\" Collins added. \"I would just say that\'s trying to get the primary immunization up to the level it needs to be -- that\'s under consideration.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/15/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html',1,107),(82,'CDC investigating monkeypox case in Dallas in traveler from Nigeria','The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health officials in Dallas said Friday they are investigating a case of an unusual virus called monkeypox in a traveler coming from Nigeria.Monkeypox is a relative of smallpox, but it\'s less transmissible and less deadly. Smallpox was eradicated in 1979 through a global vaccination campaign., The CDC and health officials in Dallas said although the traveler flew while infected, they don\'t believe it\'s likely anyone else on the flight was infected. They\'re checking just in case, though., \"The individual is a City of Dallas resident who traveled from Nigeria to Dallas, arriving at Love Field airport on July 9, 2021. The person is hospitalized in Dallas and is in stable condition,\" the Dallas County Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement., \"We have been working closely with the CDC and DSHS (the Texas Department of State Health Services) and have conducted interviews with the patient and close contacts that were exposed,\" said DCHHS Director Dr. Philip Huang. \"We have determined that there is very little risk to the general public.\", The CDC said it was working to contact airline passengers and others who may have been in contact with the patient during two flights: Lagos, Nigeria, to Atlanta on July 8, with arrival on July 9; and Atlanta to Dallas on July 9. , , , \"Travelers on these flights were required to wear masks as well as in the U.S. airports due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it\'s believed the risk of spread of monkeypox via respiratory droplets to others on the planes and in the airports is low. Working with airline and state and local health partners, CDC is assessing potential risks to those who may have had close contact with the traveler on the plane and specific settings,\" the CDC said., Rodents, including animals kept as pets, can carry monkeypox and transmit it to people. In 2003, 47 people in the US were infected with the virus. The outbreak was traced to a shipment of small mammals from Ghana that were sold as pets., There was a smaller outbreak in Britain in 2018., \"Monkeypox begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, and exhaustion. The main difference between symptoms of smallpox and monkeypox is that monkeypox causes lymph nodes to swell while smallpox does not,\" the CDC said. Like smallpox, monkeypox causes skin blisters that eventually scab over., , \"The illness typically lasts for 2−4 weeks. In Africa, monkeypox has been shown to cause death in as many as 1 in 10 persons who contract the disease,\" the CDC said.,  The strain involved in this week\'s case is much less deadly, killing perhaps 1 in 100 people, the CDC said. The smallpox vaccine can protect people from monkeypox, but the global vaccination campaign ended when that virus was eradicated, so access to the vaccine is limited., A drug called cidofovir can treat monkeypox infection, the CDC says.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/16/health/monkeypox-case-import-dallas/index.html',1,108),(83,'What regular swimming does for the body and mind','I recently went for a swim for the first time in over a year. Standing over the sparkling, blue pool at my local gym, I tried to recall many of the stressful events from the past 16 months: moving to a new city -- Baltimore -- during a pandemic, starting a new internal medicine residency training program, and taking care of both Covid and non-Covid patients in the hospital had all taken their toll.  My first thought as I dove under the surface of the water was that I felt a little more buoyant than usual, likely due to the added pounds brought on by quarantine. But as I continued to glide through the water, my initial concern about weight gain was replaced by a feeling of catharsis, as though the water were cleansing me of the stress that had accumulated during the coronavirus pandemic. Stroke after stroke, I could feel my mood lifting, my mind clearing and my body loosening. , Thirty minutes later, I got out of the pool feeling confident and level-headed, ready to begin the first of four night shifts in the intensive care unit. I usually dread the first of these night shifts, but somehow the task seemed more manageable than usual. \"Whatever happens tonight, happens,\" I told myself encouragingly. \"No matter what, there will always be tomorrow.\", My improved mood was in no doubt related to my recent dip in the pool. Like all types of physical activity, swimming can improve your mood by stimulating the production of endorphins -- natural opioids produced in the brain -- as well as other neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin., But the benefits of taking a swim go far beyond a momentary lift in spirits -- especially right now., Changing your mind, As we all emerge from isolation, experts say attending to our mental health needs to be a top priority. , \"Americans have faced unprecedented hardship in the past months, but by focusing daily on caring for our own emotional well-being and supporting the well-being of those we love, we can successfully mitigate the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said former US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams in a news release earlier this year. , \"Although this is a difficult time in our nation\'s history, I remain steadfast in encouraging Americans to use healthy mechanisms to cope,\" he added. , The prevalence of depressive symptoms in the United States increased more than threefold as Covid-19 spread, according to a recent study in the journal JAMA. Some high-risk groups, including health care workers and those under the age of 30, were at an even greater risk of developing anxiety or depression due to the pandemic, according to a different study published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research. , Regular exercise -- including swimming, running, yoga, weight training and even tai chi -- remains one of the most powerful tools we have to improve our mood and overall mental health. A 2016 meta-analysis that combined data from 23 randomly controlled trials showed that exercise was comparable to both antidepressants and psychotherapy in the treatment of depression.  , While part of this is due to the production of endorphins, exercise also results in important structural changes in the brain, particularly in a primitive brain structure called the hippocampus. Along with another brain structure called the amygdala, the hippocampus is heavily involved in memory formation and the regulation of emotions.    , Over time, regular aerobic exercise -- such as running and swimming -- reduces inflammation and promotes nerve growth in the hippocampus, with positive effects on both mood and memory, studies have shown. Conversely, atrophy, or shrinkage, of the hippocampus has been linked to the development of mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder. , Subscribe to CNN\'s Fitness, But Better newsletter: Get back in the groove. Sign up for our newsletter series to ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts, Defying evolution, Our mental health is not the only thing that has been affected by the Covid pandemic: Our bodies have taken a toll as well. The average American gained approximately 7 pounds during the pandemic, according to another study published in JAMA. , \"The effects of COVID on long-term health are worrying,\" said Daniel Lieberman, professor in the department of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University, in an e-mail. Lieberman is also the author of \"Exercised: Why Something We Never Evolved to Do Is Healthy and Rewarding.\" , \"To what extent these added pounds come from diet, (lack of) exercise or stress is difficult to unravel, but well documented declines in physical activity are clearly one cause,\" Lieberman added., As with all forms of aerobic exercise, swimming is also a great way to strengthen muscles and burn fat. But swimming comes with one additional benefit: Human swimmers typically spend about seven times as much energy to move a given distance compared to running. , This is because humans did not necessarily evolve to be expert swimmers, according to Lieberman. The fastest human swimmers can only attain speeds of about 4.5 miles per hour -- the speed at which most people switch from a fast walk to a slow run. , While this aspect of swimming may be frustrating for new swimmers, when it comes to losing weight, it may not be a bad thing. , \"You have only to watch a seal or a beaver swim to realize that compared to mammals adapted for swimming, even the best human swimmers perform poorly,\" Lieberman added. \"The good news is that this inefficiency makes swimming a very effective exercise for burning calories.\" , There are many other aspects of swimming that make it a uniquely beneficial form of exercise. For example, when we swim, we are completely horizontal, which increases blood return from the venous system to the heart., This distinctive aspect of swimming comes with additional cardiac benefits as well. For example, maximum heart rates are about 10-15 beats slower during swimming compared to running, increasing the amount of time when the heart can relax and fill with blood, known as \"diastolic function.\" As a result, the heart\'s stroke volume -- or the amount of blood pumped by the heart during each beat -- increases by 30% to 60% during swimming, according to a 2013 study in the International Journal of Cardiology. , Swimming is also different from other forms of aerobic exercise because it relies on controlled breathing. Over time, this can lead to an increase in total lung capacity and improved overall lung functioning. , But if you have limited access to a pool or large body of water, or feel like you can\'t swim for very long, don\'t worry: What is most important is that you stay active this summer and choose an activity that you enjoy doing, according to Lieberman., \"If you struggle to exercise, remember that even a little exercise provides enormous benefits for both physical and mental health. You don\'t have to run a marathon or swim the English Channel,\" Lieberman said. \"And if you don\'t like to exercise, find a way to make it enjoyable. For most people, that means making it social. Exercising with friends will help you find the motivation to show up and keep going.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/16/health/swimming-covid-blues-weight-loss-wellness/index.html',1,109),(84,'What the new CDC guidance for schools means for children ','Five full days a week, every week: After more than a year of remote learning, hybrid schedules and missed experiences, getting back to school -- \"normal\" school -- is all many parents and students want. But with The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance last week on the importance of having all schools opened for in-person, full-time instruction in the fall. To safely keep schools open, the CDC recommended what it calls \"a layered mitigation strategy.\" This is a systematic strategy involving multiple interventions to reduce risk, such as including the use of indoor masks for unvaccinated students and teachers., , What happens if schools reopen but don\'t enforce these procedures? For example, what should parents do if schools don\'t require masks? Should vaccinated children over 12 feel comfortable removing their masks in schools? And when might vaccines be available for younger children?, We asked CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen for her thoughts. Wen is an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She\'s also author of a book coming out later this month, \"Lifelines: A Doctor\'s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.\" , CNN: With the more contagious Delta variant circulating, are these CDC guidelines enough to keep students, teachers, staff and their families safe?, Dr. Leana Wen: Yes. At this point, we have plenty of data that schools can be very safe from a Covid-19 transmission standpoint if mitigation measures are followed. The CDC has been very thoughtful in its guidance, which cites numerous scientific articles to explain its strategic approach., , Specifically, the CDC is saying that indoor masking is important for unvaccinated people. That\'s because the unvaccinated are still at high risk for getting and transmitting coronavirus. Vaccination protects people very well, so, consistent with the rest of the guidance for vaccinated individuals, the CDC is saying vaccinated people don\'t need to mask indoors. It recommends weekly testing for unvaccinated students and staff, which could be more frequent for individuals involved in certain, higher-risk extracurricular activities. And there are other mitigation measures, too, such as an investment in improved ventilation using federal Covid relief funds and keeping students at home when they are having any possible symptoms of Covid-19. All these measures added together will substantially reduce transmission risk in schools., CNN: But what about not being able to have 6-foot physical distancing? The CDC is saying this is no longer required., Wen: For many schools, it wouldn\'t be possible to have all children back full time and still keep 6-foot distancing. That\'s why the CDC says to try to keep 3-foot distancing, and to employ other mitigation measures to make up the difference if needed., Here\'s where the layered mitigation strategy is so important. Think of it like wearing layers. If it\'s not very cold outside, having one or two layers of protection is enough. If it\'s very cold, you need multiple layers. If you remove one layer, you could replace it with another, different type of layer, and it still does the job., , Physical distancing is a powerful layer of protection. If it\'s no longer there, you could replace it with other layers. In this case, even if there is no distancing but there is vaccination, masking and regular testing, that would protect against coronavirus transmission. The goal is to reduce community rates of Covid-19 as much as possible. In areas of low transmission, you don\'t need to employ all these layers anymore -- just as you wouldn\'t need to wear a lot of layers of clothing after the weather warmed up., CNN: When can kids stop wearing masks in schools?, Wen: Again, I\'d think of this using the weather and layers analogy. If the vaccination rate in a community is very high and the level of coronavirus is very low, it\'s conceivable that indoor masking no longer needs to be enforced. However, we are not there yet as a country, and that\'s why the CDC is saying that masks are required indoors for unvaccinated people., CNN: What does the latest data tell us about infection rates for children and severity of their symptoms?, Wen: During the pandemic, more than 4 million children have been diagnosed with Covid-19. As more adults are now vaccinated, children make up a larger proportion of those getting infected; as of July 8, children make up more than 1 in 5 in new infections. , The Delta variant is the most contagious variant we have seen, which may mean that unvaccinated children are more likely to transmit and to get infected with this variant than before. It\'s not clear that children become more ill -- and we need to keep in mind that in general, children with Covid-19 infections tend to get much less severely ill than adults. However, children can have long-term consequences from Covid-19 that last months or potentially even years. , CNN: There are at least five states that are not allowing schools to implement mask mandates. What should parents do if their schools don\'t require masks?, Wen: This is tricky. I\'d first inquire with the school administrators to see how many children and staff are still likely to be wearing masks. If nearly everyone wears a mask anyway, even if it\'s not required, that would be fine., On the other hand, if few others are going to wear masks, you should consider whether your child could still do it. If they can, it would still protect them, but it\'s possible that peer pressure is such that they might not keep their mask on. In that case, you should be asking about what other mitigation measures are in place. If there are -- say, the schools have improved ventilation, and they also implement once- or ideally twice-weekly testing for unvaccinated students and teachers -- I\'d feel better (in this sense, testing replaces the mask)., CNN: What\'s the risk to children under 12 if teachers are unvaccinated and not masking?, Wen: They are not supposed to be doing that, but I think this question is getting at the problem that the CDC is not offering any guidance for how to verify vaccination status. For many schools, it will probably be an honor code, and if teachers are not wearing masks, there is no way to know whether it\'s because they\'re vaccinated and following the guidance, or if they\'re unvaccinated and defying the guidance., Whenever layers of mitigation are removed, they should be replaced by other layers. If there are unvaccinated, unmasked teachers around, this does add risk. The risk can be reduced if that teacher is regularly tested and keeps a good distance away from students, but ideally, this situation does not occur in the first place., CNN: What if vaccinated teachers get breakthrough infections? Can they be a risk to unvaccinated children?, Wen: I\'m actually much less concerned about this. Vaccination protects very well against getting Covid-19 -- and spreading it. It\'s still theoretically possible that a vaccinated person can be ill and shed enough virus to infect others, but my concern is much more about the unvaccinated people spreading coronavirus to one another., CNN: What about children in middle school and high school, where some children are vaccinated and some are not? If my child is vaccinated, is it OK for him to take off his mask at school or at after-school activities?, Wen: You should follow the regulations and the norms of your school. Some schools might still require masks, because they are not asking for proof of vaccination. Others might have such high vaccination rates that every kid in a classroom is vaccinated; in that case, it\'s definitely safe for your vaccinated child to go without a mask. If your child is not vaccinated, though, he should be wearing a mask in indoor spaces., , I\'d definitely make sure that you monitor what your child is doing after school. It would be a shame to follow strict Covid-19 protocols during school, only to engage in high-risk activities outside of the classroom that add unnecessary risk to your child and your family. The rule of thumb is that if your vaccinated child is around other vaccinated kids, there is extremely low risk, and they can engage with one another without masks, distancing or other coronavirus restrictions. The risk becomes a little higher every time there are unvaccinated people in the group. And if your child is unvaccinated, they really shouldn\'t be indoors with other unvaccinated individuals without masks., CNN: Will kids under 12 be able to be vaccinated before the school year?, Wen: That\'s unlikely. Even if a vaccine were authorized right now for younger children, it would take several weeks to complete the two-dose inoculations and wait two weeks beyond that to be deemed fully vaccinated. , , It\'s estimated that vaccines for younger children may be available later this fall, with elementary-age children likely becoming eligible first, followed by toddlers and babies. For now, before a vaccine is available, younger unvaccinated kids should wear masks when in indoor, crowded settings around others in their peer groups. , The point of the CDC\'s guidelines is to emphasize that it\'s really crucial for our kids to be back for in-person school. Our children have lost so much during the pandemic. It\'s our obligation to do our part and implement the necessary infection control protocols so that they can be back learning, safely, in the fall.

And though many may brush off the risk of low vaccination rates to children, citing their low Covid-19 mortality rates, Hotez said they are still at risk for serious complications., In Mississippi, seven children are in intensive care with Covid-19, and two are on ventilators, State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs tweeted Tuesday evening. Many more adolescents could be hospitalized, Hotez said, adding that up to 30% of children infected will develop long-haul Covid-19., Nationwide, the overall number of new daily Covid-19 hospitalizations will likely increase over the next four weeks, an ensemble forecast published Wednesday by the CDC projects. There will likely be 2,100 to 11,000 new confirmed Covid-19 hospital admissions on August 9, the forecast says. Hospitalizations had been on a steady decline since late April, US Department of Health and Human Services data shows., Scientists also are now learning about neurological consequences to long-haul Covid-19, Hotez said. Some studies have shown impacts on the brain of people who have been infected with the virus. One study in April found 34% of Covid-19 survivors received a diagnosis for a neurological or psychological condition within six months of their infection. , \"What you\'re doing is your condemning a whole generation of adolescents to neurologic injury totally unnecessarily,\" Hotez said. \"It\'s just absolutely heartbreaking and beyond frustrating for vaccine scientists like myself to see this happen.\", Debate over vaccine mandates, With experts stressing the importance in vaccinating a majority of Americans against the virus, some officials are debating whether to mandate vaccinations at the local level. Some schools and employers have already implemented measures requiring students and employees to be vaccinated before returning. , Last month, Morgan Stanley announced unvaccinated employees, guests and clients would be banned from its New York headquarters. In April, Houston Methodist, a network of eight hospitals, said it would require all of its employees to get vaccinated. Of the 26,000 employees, 153 resigned or were fired as a result of refusing the vaccine., That same month, the American College Health Association issued a policy statement recommending Covid-19 vaccination requirements for all on-campus college and university students for the upcoming fall semester, where state law and resources allow., But many states are moving to block such requirements. , At least seven states -- Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Montana, Oklahoma and Utah -- have enacted legislation this year that would restrict public schools from requiring either coronavirus vaccinations or documentation of vaccination status, a CNN analysis found., Such legislation can hurt the nation\'s 48 million Americans under the age of 12, former Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius said Tuesday. Currently, Covid-19 vaccines are only available in the US to people 12 and older. Vaccine trials are underway for children 6 months through 11 years old. , \"If we start with a lens on the children and wanting children to get back to school, which is what we all say is the priority, then we have to get more serious about employers and schools and universities stepping up and saying, \'It\'s great if you don\'t want to be vaccinated. But if you don\'t, you really can\'t have access to places that will put you in contact with folks who can\'t get vaccinated,\'\" Sebelius said., The CDC announced last week it prioritizes in-person learning, even if all Covid-19 safety measures aren\'t in place. As K-12 schools will have a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated people, it\'s necessary to layer strategies such as masking, physical distancing and, most importantly, vaccinations for everyone eligible -- people age 12 and older, the agency said. , The federal government can support vaccine use by expediting the full approval of available vaccines, Sebelius said. Vaccines are now available in the US under emergency use authorization. , \"Getting full approval -- getting out of the emergency use authorization and into full approval -- is something that will clear up any legal questions that private employers may have,\" she said., Study suggests why Delta variant is more contagious, The Delta variant might spread faster than other strains of the novel coronavirus because it makes more copies of itself inside people\'s bodies quicker than other strains of the coronavirus., In research posted online last week, Chinese scientists detected on initial positive tests Delta viral loads that were about 1,260 times higher than earlier strains. They compared 62 Delta cases with 63 cases from the early epidemic wave in 2020., Moreover, the amount of time it took quarantined people to test positive for coronavirus on PCR also shortened -- from about six days with the earlier infections to four days with Delta., \"These data highlight that the Delta variant could be more infectious during the early stage of the infection,\" the researchers wrote., According to Public Health England, a number of analyses have shown Delta to be more transmissible, including lab studies that suggest \"increased replication in biological systems that model human airway, and evidence of optimised furin cleavage\" -- a process that activates the virus\' entry into the human cell. The variant has also been observed to spread faster in real-world epidemiological studies., According to the World Health Organization, Delta is estimated to spread roughly 55% faster than the Alpha variant first identified in the UK, and roughly twice as fast as variants that do not rise to the level of \"interest\" or \"concern.\", Heath officials have said that cases caused by the Delta variant in fully vaccinated people are rare and the strain is for the most part only causing severe disease and death in unvaccinated people. , And health officials aren\'t just concerned about the Covid-19 risks for people who are unvaccinated, but also the risks for a significant number of people who are partially vaccinated -- especially those who are overdue for their second dose or skipped their second-dose appointments., The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus vaccines are administered as two doses, 21 and 28 days apart, respectively. Studies have shown that those vaccines are much more effective against the Delta variant after completion of the two-dose series. People who have received one dose should still follow Covid-19 mitigation steps, such as wearing masks, until they are fully vaccinated.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/health/us-coronavirus-wednesday/index.html',1,114),(87,'How to speak to someone who\'s hesitant to get vaccinated','As a pediatrician, Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez spends many of her days with nervous moms and dads listening to reasons why they\'re worried about their kids receiving vaccinations.\"It often manifests as just complete disagreements on how to raise kids,\" Bracho-Sanchez said., To navigate the complexity, she tells her families that she would never judge parents or accuse them of not loving their kids any less if they\'re afraid of vaccinations. She just asks that they talk about it., For some childhood vaccines it can take years, but skeptical parents often come around., , She is now applying those hard won experiences, in a more accelerated way, nudging families toward getting shots for their kids in how she talks with her own family members hesitant to get their Covid-19 shot., \"These are new vaccines and that comes with a reaction and a fear that is very real,\" she said. \"I think we also have to remember there is massive misinformation out there.\", Her skills, and those of pediatricians like her, can help you as you talk with your own loved ones about getting protected against Covid-19., Vaccine hesitancy is shrinking, Nearly 185 million Americans have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., In May, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 64% of American adults have gotten or want a Covid-19 vaccine as soon as possible, 15% will wait and see and 19% will either definitely not get one or will only get one if it is required., Getting the country over the threshold of herd immunity means finding ways to persuade at least a portion of the people who are still hesitant to get their shot., In more hopeful news, roughly one-fifth of Americans who were initially hesitant about or squarely against getting the Covid-19 vaccine  have since gotten their shots, according to polling released Tuesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation., Those who had decided to be vaccinated after saying they weren\'t sure about or didn\'t intend to get the shot \"often say that family, friends and their personal doctors helped change their minds,\" the foundation found., In that same poll, those who remain unvaccinated reported their main reasons for still not getting a Covid-19 vaccine. Concerns about side effects was most cited (21%), followed by concerns the vaccine was too new, too unknown or not tested enough (16%). Twelve percent reported that they haven\'t gotten a vaccine because they don\'t think they need it. , Give people space, and listen to their concerns, For many, Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy manifests simply as a fear of something new., \"It is a normal human reaction to be afraid. Fear is very real. It does not make you stupid. It\'s normal,\" Bracho-Sanchez said. \"They\'re having a normal reaction and perhaps they haven\'t been able to sit down with their physician.\", Look for a time to have a calm, rational conversation, where neither person is angry or likely to start a fight., , \"The first thing I would say is \'I get it. I totally get where you\'re coming from and I understand that you\'re concerned about this,\'\" Bracho-Sanchez said., As you\'re having a conversation with loved one, she emphasized being an active and empathetic listener., \"If you really care about someone and you\'re trying to help them think through something that could be beneficial for their health, if you yell, if you are condescending, if you share too much that they\'re not willing to hear, you might lose that bond, and it closes the door for future conversations,\" she said., As a pediatrician, Bracho-Sanchez has succeeded by nudging parents over the course of multiple conversations., In addition to listening to people, CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen recommended addressing their concerns individually rather than using blanket statements. , \"For example, if they\'re worried the vaccine causes infertility, then we can adjust that and link to data that it is safe for pregnant individuals,\" she said., Appeal to their familial circumstances , Appealing to people\'s sense of higher obligation may not be effective, said Dr. Wen, but appealing to their familial obligations just might., Try and find out if someone in their family is elderly, immunocompromised or has young children, she said., \"Children, even if they tend to not become very sick, could potentially have long-term consequences that they live with for the rest of their lives because of the virus,\" Wen said., Cite scientific data, Skepticism to existing vaccines -- such as that for measles, mumps and rubella -- has been driven by concerns such as a spurious link to autism, which has been disproven by a significant body of research., Study after study has shown that vaccinations are safe and effective for preventing disease. , And the track record for the Covid-19 vaccines has been particularly strong. Adverse reactions are extremely rare and the vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna, for instance, have shown an ability to prevent disease well above 90%., \"I think it\'s important to note that the more that a group of people know about the vaccine, the more likely they are to take it,\" said Dr. Susan Bailey, president of the American Medical Association., Earlier this year, Pfizer released six months of data showing its vaccine is safe and effective. Steps like that could help satisfy holdouts. Some 23% of those opposed getting the vaccine cite wanting \"to wait to confirm it is safe,\" according to Gallup back in March., \"That\'s another common question that people have, \'Well I want to wait a while and see how it goes. Well, we have waited a while and everything still looks great,\" Bailey said. \"The bottom line is the greatest risk is not getting the vaccine and becoming ill with Covid.\", She recommended pointing people to Get Vaccine Answers, a website created by the Ad Council, which offers clear explanations on how the vaccines work, how they were authorized for use, and what it feels like to get vaccinated., And CNN has created a resource with helpful, scientifically informed responses to common issues that those who aren\'t sure yet about the vaccines often bring up., Emphasize the social norm, \"There are groups of people who are vaccine hesitant because it\'s part of their social identity,\" said Dr. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and a California state senator, who co-authored 2015 legislation to remove personal belief as a reason for vaccine exemptions., \"Before it was crunchy white moms who were into wellness and essential oils. That was the stereotypical vaccine hesitant mother.\", There\'s a different poster child for Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy., Pan, a Democrat, cited a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation that found 29% of Republicans and 28% of White evangelical Christians say they will \"definitely not\" get the vaccine. , \"They\'re the ones who don\'t think the Covid virus is that serious. They say that mask-wearing doesn\'t help or is for sissies,\" Pan said., While 3 in 10 are opposed, that still means a majority have either gotten vaccinated or plan to., \"In political terms, that\'s a landslide. It\'s over two-thirds,\" he said., One way to bring the remaining white conservatives on board, he added, is recognizing that most of them are already doing the right thing. And people often mimic the behavior of others in their social group., \"When they hear that you chose to vaccinate, they\'ll consider it because you\'re part of their social circle,\" Pan said. \"That becomes the social norm for your immediate social circle.\", Share why you\'re getting vaccinated, Sometimes, the best approach for Bracho-Sanchez is to get personal with new parents during their kids\' appointments., Her reason for getting the Covid-19 vaccine was simple. She was pregnant. She tells how she got the shot during her second trimester even when minimal data about the vaccines\' performance was available. , Believing in the mantra, \"Healthy mom, healthy baby,\" she wanted to be protected because she knew getting Covid-19 was worse., \"It was really well-received,\" she said. \"Moms would be like, \'Really? You did?\' And they paused and sort of thought about it.\", There are plenty of positive reasons to share., \"Another strategy is to find out what that person is interested in and what they have been missing since the pandemic began,\" Bailey said. \"Are they missing being with relatives? Are they missing events they used to attend? Have that person understand that the quickest way for us all to get back to those things that we miss is for 70% to 80% of the population to be vaccinated.\", For people wishing to travel abroad this summer, getting vaccinated could be their ticket to getting into some countries -- or at least traveling without having to take a Covid-19 test., Many destinations, such as Denmark, France and the Bahamas, have made testing optional for vaccinated individuals., Some people who were infected and subsequently plagued by long Covid symptoms have reported feeling better after their vaccinations. , Stories like that could be a light at the end of the tunnel for those who\'ve had a rough go of it living through the actual virus., Stress the importance of receiving both doses, In mid-June, 88% of people who were eligible to receive the second dose of the vaccine had done so -- down from the 92% completion rate reported earlier in the year, according to the CDC., For some people, they suffered through a range of side effects that made many hesitant to receive the second dose., It\'s crucial to receive the second dose of the vaccine, because it greatly increases the effectiveness of it, Wen said., \"Some people do have fatigue, body aches and so forth with the vaccine, but that is many times better than having Covid-19,\" she said. , Experiencing temporary side effects after receiving a vaccine is actually a positive sign, according to some doctors. It shows that your immune system is working, although the vaccine works regardless of whether you have any symptoms after you take it., Help them schedule the appointment, And finally, vaccine hesitancy could be a matter of just being unsure about how to actually make the appointment and get to the vaccination site., \"Help them schedule it,\" Bracho-Sanchez said. \"Especially people who are afraid will be like \'OK, yeah, I think I\'m going to do it.\' And then they don\'t. It\'s sometimes just because the logistics are a little bit of a hurdle.\", Pull up your local public health department\'s website together. Offer to drive them to the clinic to make it a little easier., \"If you care about someone, you should help them,\" she said. \"Say \'Let\'s do this together. Let\'s do something, so if you get vaccinated, let\'s grab dinner after. Let\'s celebrate together.\' Just something extra like that to show that you care.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/10/health/vaccine-hesitant-how-to-talk-wellness/index.html',1,115),(88,'Why these parents volunteered their young children for Covid-19 vaccine trials','As Now, toddlers and babies as young as 6 months old are testing Covid-19 vaccines to help make sure they\'re safe for other young children. If the pediatric trials go well, children under 12 might be eligible to get vaccinated this fall or winter., For many parents, the decision to volunteer their kids was easy. , One family knows the anguish of suddenly losing a healthy child to unexpected illness and doesn\'t want any other family to endure the same. , Other parents want their children to go back to school and play with friends safely -- without masks and without worrying about new coronavirus strains or complications such as MIS-C., And one family is so passionate about helping protect kids, they\'ve enrolled all three children -- ages 6, 3, and 14 months -- in a Covid-19 vaccine trial. , Here\'s what parents who have stepped up to volunteer their children want other families to know:, , \'You don\'t want to be that statistic\' , Rebecca and Michael Calloway never imagined they would lose their healthy, energetic toddler to an unexpected illness., Shortly after Thanksgiving, 3-year-old Ailish became severely sick and was hospitalized with swelling in her brain. She died just a few days later. , \"It turned out that she had undiagnosed type 1 diabetes,\" Rebecca Calloway said. Type 1 diabetes is not preventable, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says., \"We lost our daughter to something we couldn\'t control,\" Calloway said. , But Covid-19 \"is something we can control. (Vaccines) have been shown to work for millions of Americans.\" , \"We can be part of showing people that yes, this is safe,\" the mother from rural Maryland said., \"This is going to keep your children safe. It\'s going to keep (those) who cannot be vaccinated safe. We want to be part of that.\", So her 7-year-old daughter Georgia is testing the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. , Their youngest child, 2-year-old Lochlan, is already a vaccine trial veteran. When he was 2 months old, he started participating in a meningitis vaccine trial., \"They want to work towards improving it for younger children because meningitis is something that young children are still getting and dying from,\" Calloway said. , While childhood deaths from meningitis, type 1 diabetes and Covid-19 are rare, they do happen. And when it happens to your family, Calloway said, the grief is overwhelming., \"You don\'t want to be that statistic,\" she said. \"I would never, ever want someone to go through the pain of losing a child. It\'s devastating beyond anything that you can imagine.\", Even before Ailish\'s death, the Calloways planned to support vaccine trials because their relatives suffered consequences from not being vaccinated in the past., \"My family and my husband\'s family have a history with fallout from not having vaccines,\" Calloway said. , Michael\'s grand-aunt died from diphtheria. His father nearly died from whooping cough. Rebecca\'s grandmother had polio and contracted rubella while she was pregnant with Rebecca\'s uncle, who was born completely deaf and with brain and heart problems., \"We\'ve seen the effects of what can happen without vaccines. Those are very real to us in our family,\" Rebecca Calloway said., Even at age 3, Ailish also had a passion for helping others. She started telling everyone she wanted to be a doctor. , Calloway said Ailish would have been so proud of her sister Georgia for testing the Covid-19 vaccine. , \"Georgia was her hero,\" their mother said. , Without vaccinating kids, it\'s \'going to be impossible to get to herd immunity\', Dr. CJ Bui is a pediatric neurosurgeon. But when Covid-19 started overwhelming hospitals, he and other doctors from different specialties volunteered to help treat Covid-19 patients., \"Seeing how bad it can be for adults, (even) young adults\" was sobering, the Louisiana doctor said. \"I\'ve seen a healthy 30-something-year-old die a miserable death.\", Now, as more problematic variants spread among unvaccinated people, Bui and his wife have enrolled all three of their children in a Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine trial. , \"We both saw how terribly Covid affected patients,\" said Bui\'s wife, neurosurgeon Dr. Erin Biro. \"We felt strongly about participating in the research -- obviously for the opportunity to have our kids vaccinated (and) to continue to move the needle forward in the battle against Covid.\", Their 6-year-old daughter Ellie got her first shot June 8. Her younger brother Christian, 3, and baby sister Sloane, 14 months, received their first injections June 21., This Phase 2/3 of the Pfizer study is double-blinded, so the family doesn\'t know whether each child received a dose of Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. Six months after the second injections, the study will be \"unblinded,\" and those who got a placebo will be able to get the real vaccine. , None of three Bui children had side effects after their injections, their parents said. , Before volunteering their children, Bui and Biro evaluated the risks and benefits -- from the perspectives of both doctors and parents. , \"If you really look at the data, the risk is exponentially lower from this vaccine than a lot of common medications. So that played a role,\" Bui said., Another reason was the need to suppress coronavirus before it mutates into more dangerous variants or ones that could evade vaccine protection. , Bui said without widespread child vaccination, \"It\'s really going to be impossible to get to herd immunity\" -- or the point at which enough people are protected against a virus to suppress its spread., As more variants develop and spread among unvaccinated people, the bar for reaching herd immunity may become higher. , \"We\'re potentially one variant away from removing all this progress,\" he said. , Bui\'s also concerned about MIS-C, or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children -- a rare but potentially serious condition that can happen in children weeks after a coronavirus infection., The doctors also share a desire echoed by many parents: They want children to learn in classrooms, \"full time and back to school safely,\" Biro said., \"And safely, for us, meant vaccination.\", How children\'s Covid-19 vaccine trials work , The only Covid-19 vaccine available to minors in the US is the Pfizer vaccine, which is authorized for ages 12 and up. (Moderna has asked for its vaccine to be authorized for ages 12 to 17.), Both Pfizer and Moderna have started Covid-19 vaccine trials in children between ages 6 months and 11 years. , In the first part of Moderna\'s Phase 2/3 pediatric trial, all participants get vaccinated at varying levels, with no placebos. And families know what dose their kids are getting., Children ages 2 to 11 are given one of two possible dose levels -- 50 micrograms or 100 micrograms per dose. (Each adult dose is 100 micrograms.) Participants ages 6 months up to 2 years may get one of three dose levels -- 25, 50 or 100 micrograms., \"An interim analysis will be conducted to determine which dose will be used in Part 2, the placebo-controlled expansion portion of the study,\" Moderna said., Some may be surprised babies could test adult doses. But parents don\'t need to worry about a so-called overdose, said pediatrician Dr. James Campbell, lead investigator of the Moderna children\'s vaccine study at the University of Maryland School of Medicine., \"These are very, very small amounts,\" he told CNN. \"So when you\'re talking half or double of a very small amount, it\'s still a very small amount. You cannot overdose on vaccine doses.\", What might happen is higher doses may lead to more side effects. That\'s what investigators are trying to determine, Campbell said., \"Could it be that 100 micrograms leads to 10% of people having fever, and 50 micrograms leads to 5% having fever? ... That\'s what we\'re looking for,\" he said., Scientists are trying to see which doses yield the best combination of high efficacy and minimal side effects. , Of course, 6-month-olds can\'t describe any side effects they might get. So how would parents know if their young child is having side effects? , \"It\'s the same as any other child who gets ill -- they get fussy,\" said Dr. Julia Garcia-Diaz, a lead investigator for Pfizer\'s pediatric vaccine study at New Orleans\' Ochsner Hospital for Children. , \"They\'re not eating the same, or they\'re fussy and they just cry. Parents are attuned to how their child behaves,\" she told CNN., Any adverse side effects from vaccines almost always \"show up within the first two weeks, and certainly by the first two months\" after vaccination, Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told CNN in April., Garcia-Diaz agreed with that time frame., \"After that, your body has made the antibodies. It has done what it is supposed to do,\" she said. \"So most likely things that are outside that window are not related.\", While some families are hesitant to vaccinate their children, many have been eager to participate in the vaccine trials, Campbell and Garcia-Diaz said. , \"There has been a great deal of interest,\" said Garcia-Diaz, director of clinical infectious diseases research at Ochsner Health., \"The parents had been calling us for weeks on end trying to find out when the trial starts.\", Pfizer\'s trial for young children started in March, and it expects to ask the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization for ages 2 to 11 years in September, the company said., Moderna said if trials go well, its vaccine may be available for children under 12 years old this winter or in early 2022., A 9-year-old feels like he\'s helping \'save the world\', Dr. Charles Mugera has seen patients rapidly deteriorate with Covid-19., \"I was admitting patients every day, sending them to the ICU -- some of them dying on the floor,\" said Mugera, an internist in Maryland. \"Going to work every day was scary, not only for what\'s going to happen to patients but what\'s going to happen to us\" health care workers. , \"This vaccine has just changed the game entirely.\", He\'s been monitoring the data and knows as vaccinations go up, Covid-19 numbers go down. , \"We have seen not only deaths, hospitalizations and infection go down, but transmissibility has gone down because we\'re vaccinated don\'t transmit the disease,\" Mugera said. , \"So it becomes very clear that for this pandemic to end, we have to not only protect ourselves from severe disease but (also) get the children vaccinated. Because even though the children have not been perceived as being at risk for death and severe disease, they transmit it.\"  , His wife, Dr. Kabuiya Ruth Mugera, is a pediatrician who also believes children need to be vaccinated against Covid-19. , So they asked their two sons -- Gerald, then 11, and Christian, 9 -- if they would participate in the Moderna vaccine trial. , \"Educating them and getting them on board -- yeah, that took a little bit of convincing,\" Mugera said, especially given a fear of needles.  , Their mother \"explained how it works, what it does, how it protects you, and how you get your life back. You can travel. Go back to having birthday parties. Go back to school (in-person),\" Mugera said. , \"That crystallized in their minds very quickly that this is the path to normalcy.\" , But because the trial requires blood draws to monitor for antibodies, and Gerald had difficulty getting blood drawn, only Christian was selected for the trial., The 9-year-old has received both doses of the Moderna vaccine -- the full adult dosage each time. , Christian had a sore arm after his first dose and a fever, muscle aches and lethargy after his second dose. But 24 hours later, he was fine., Mugera admits the family was on high alert for anything that might resemble an adverse side effect. He got nervous when Christian developed a rash. , \"Initially we were like, oh my goodness, is this something from the vaccine?\" he said. , But Gerald -- who was not vaccinated -- later broke out with the same rash. It turned out to be contact dermatitis after both boys played outside and climbed a tree. , Gerald recently turned 12 and was able to get the Pfizer vaccine. Now the entire family is looking forward to an overseas vacation., Though Christian was initially hesitant to get vaccinated, he\'s now excited to play with friends without masks and go back to his normal childhood without worry, Mugera said., He\'s also proud to help other kids by testing the vaccine for them. Christian\'s dad said his younger son has developed a new mantra:, \"We\'re going to save the world. We\'re going to change the world.\" ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/29/health/covid-vaccine-trials-babies-children/index.html',1,116),(89,'Why a Covid-19 vaccine isn\'t available for kids yet','Americans 12 and older can get a Covid-19 vaccine, but younger children are still waiting.With many schools across the United States now just weeks from reopening for the fall semester, pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna are still doing clinical trials to see how coronavirus vaccines work in children under 12 -- if they\'re safe and what the right dose should be., Meanwhile, all but four states are seeing an increasing trend in cases, with doctors describing patients who are younger and sicker than what they saw in the winter., The surge in cases has many parents of children under 12 asking when their little and not-so-little ones can get the vaccine. The answer is that it\'s going to be months, if not longer. It\'s not as simple as administering available adult doses to younger people., \"I understand parents\' concern in wanting their children to get vaccinated, but we have to make sure we\'re doing the best and safest thing for children,\" Dr. Chip Walter, a pediatrician at Duke University and an investigator for the Pfizer trials, said., When we might be able to vaccinate children under 12, Pfizer\'s vaccine study is enrolling more than 4,600 children in three age groups: 5-to-11-year-olds; 2-to-5-year-olds; and babies 6 months up to age 2. , Data for children 5 to 11 could come sometime in September and depending on the findings, the company told CNN  it could ask the US Food and Drug Administration to authorize emergency use of the vaccine that same month., Data for 2-to-5-year-olds could arrive soon after. For the youngest children, Pfizer said it could potentially get data in October or November, and shortly thereafter ask the FDA to authorize emergency use., Emergency use considerations by the FDA can take several weeks, meaning a vaccine for younger children likely won\'t be available until late fall or even next year. , Moderna\'s vaccine study is enrolling about 6,700 children ages 6 months to 11 years. It declined to provide a timeline to CNN on when it could potentially have trial data results., \"The companies have said the fall ... I\'d be surprised if they can move that quickly, although I suppose it\'s possible,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccinologist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said., \"I can\'t imagine that we\'d be in a position to even consider how to use these vaccines until the very end of the calendar year of 2021, going into the first quarter of 2022,\" said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University and one of the lead investigators for Moderna\'s pediatric Covid-19 vaccine. \"I love that we\'re riding the success of how quickly we were able to get a vaccine for adults, but we\'ve just got to be patient.\", \'Children are not just little adults\', A year and a half into the pandemic, parents might wonder why isn\'t there a vaccine for younger children yet. After all, some young kids are just as big as older children for whom the vaccine is authorized., \"Boy, have I had this discussion with several parents,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University and a vaccine adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"It doesn\'t have anything to do with size. It has everything to do with maturity of the immune system, and that doesn\'t correlate one-to-one with the size of the child.\", Young children may need different doses. They may need a different number of doses. They may not need as many doses., \"We don\'t know for young kids,\" Creech said. \"Children are not just little adults.\", And children aren\'t all the same, either., \"What you may see in a child that\'s six months of age may differ from what you see in a child that\'s 3 years of age versus a child who\'s 8 years of age, or versus an adolescent who\'s 13 or 14. So, you really kind of need to take each age separately and evaluate the vaccines,\" Walter said., Creech said finding the \"Goldilocks dose\" for young children takes time. Give too little and the child may not make enough of an immune response to the coronavirus. Then they\'re getting a vaccine with the potential for side effects with little or no benefit., \"We never like to do that. That\'s away from goodness,\" Creech said., But give children too much and the balance swings in the other direction., \"You\'re getting a good immune response, but you\'re unnecessarily triggering things like fever, arm pain, fatigue and fussiness,\" he said. \"If I get a vaccine and my arm hurts for the day, my wife might make fun of me, but it\'s not that big of a deal. I\'ll just whine a little bit. But if a two-year-old gets a shot in the thigh, has such severe leg pain that they can\'t crawl or walk, well now we\'ve got a different issue, and that produces a great deal more anxiety.\", Watching for effects in children, For kids who may be on the cusp of being eligible, the reason they can\'t get the vaccine is also, in part, a bit arbitrary. , \"Certainly some children are bigger than others. You might have a really large 10-year-old who\'s the size of a 12-year-old where the vaccine\'s indicated, but in general we work on recommendations for certain age groups and it\'s really best to go by that guidance,\" Walter said., Hotez and Creech agreed., \"Is there something dramatically different between an 11-year-old and a 12-year-old? Probably not. But you\'ve got to draw a line somewhere, and historically, the FDA has considered preteens to be different than teenagers from a regulatory standpoint,\" Creech said., \"Why was the decision made to do it at 12 instead of 11 or 10 or 14, that I don\'t know. I guess you could have moved that goal post either way, probably,\" Hotez said., Another reason the vaccine is moving slowly: the companies want to make sure it doesn\'t make children who get Covid-19 sicker, a scenario called immune enhancement. That\'s based on what happened in the 1960s with a vaccine that was supposed to defend against RSV, respiratory syncytial virus infection, Hotez said., \"It caused this immune enhancement phenomena that actually made the disease worse, so I think that would be one consideration -- making certain that\'s not happening,\" he said., Hotez said the companies also want to make sure the vaccine doesn\'t worsen a rare but serious post-Covid-19 related disease called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or MIS-C. In some instances, it has led to neurological abnormalities and deaths., \"You want to make sure the vaccine is not worsening that,\" Hotez said. \"That may take more time in order to convince both the companies and the regulators that these kinds of phenomenon are not occurring.\", One more reason a vaccine for younger children is taking time: for Covid-19, it was evident that older people were more seriously affected, so the vaccine trials started with them., \"Children were not considered to be a high risk from dying from this virus, which is true,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\'s Hospital in Philadelphia and vaccine adviser to the FDA. \"In the scheme of things, when you were trying to do the best you could, as quick as you could, children were not a priority.\", Testing vaccines in adults first is a very traditional way of assessing them, Schaffner said., \"You let the the first people who volunteer to get these vaccines be older adults, and then middle aged adults, and then we work our way down the age ladder,\" he said. \"Somebody may ask, \'Gee, why don\'t you do them simultaneously?\' Well, there\'s not that bandwidth. You just can\'t do too many trials simultaneously.\", Schaffner said in the end, the pace should reassure parents., \"There are a lot of parents who are very wary of giving these vaccines to children, and they want to be assured that these vaccines are indeed, as we say, safe and effective,\" he said. \"Do younger children need the same dose? Are they going to have a different spectrum of side effects than do older adults? All of these things have to be worked out very carefully, so we can be transparent and honest when we talk to parents about getting, for example, a six year old vaccinated.\", Covid-19 and the risk to children, Although far more rare than in adults, children can suffer, be hospitalized and die from the coronavirus. Plus, this virus does something other viruses that have vaccines, like chickenpox and measles, do not do; it can cause long-term side effects -- post-infection phenomena like MIS-C and also long Covid-19, where symptoms can drag on for months., For now, while the world waits for a vaccine, unvaccinated young children remain vulnerable., \"Kids are going to continue to be exposed. Kids are going to continue to transmit, although it seems, at least based on our experience so far in the pandemic, that they may be less efficient at that than adult counterparts,\" Creech said., This has Offit concerned about the coming school year, when young children will return to classrooms unvaccinated., \"If I have a 10- and 8-year-old child, I would really be nervous to send them back to school,\" he said. \"I certainly would want them to be masked and social distance as much as possible, but I\'d also have to expect the school did that -- that everybody in the school did that -- and that\'s a lot to ask. I think in many schools that won\'t happen.\", The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week updated its Covid-19 guidance for schools to emphasize in-person schooling is a priority in the fall, regardless of whether all mitigation measures can be implemented. Vaccination, it said, is a key safety measure, but more layers of protection -- such as masks and social distancing -- may be appropriate, too., Hotez said parents\' concerns may vary depending on where their children attend school in the country., \"If you\'re in Vermont and Massachusetts, or up in the Northeast or parts of the West Coast, so many people are vaccinated -- such a high percentage of adults and adolescents are vaccinated -- that that will have the collateral benefit of stopping or slowing transmission so that even the little kids can go back to school,\" he said., But Hotez said that\'s not the case in other parts of the country, such as Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, where the Delta variant is accelerating among adult populations that remain significantly undervaccinated., \"There\'s going to be quite a lot of transmission in the schools,\" he said. \"We know this may not go well in the fall.\", Creech was more optimistic about the coming school year., \"We have some experience from last year when the pandemic raged, and in some areas of our country schools were reopened. I think we can do in-person education in a way that is very reasonable for children,\" he said. \"We do know that there are some risk mitigation strategies that we can deploy.\", Right now, the best way to protect young children who can\'t get vaccinated is to get everybody in a community vaccinated., \"I can\'t think of a higher calling than to get a shot in the arm to protect not just myself, but those around me, particularly those that are most vulnerable,\" Creech said. \"If we can\'t get enthusiastic about protecting the vulnerable around us, and the children around us, then we\'ve got bigger problems than the pandemic.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/15/health/covid-19-vaccine-young-children-wellness/index.html',1,117),(90,'Millions of children worldwide missed routine vaccinations during the pandemic, study suggests','The coronavirus pandemic may have caused the \"most widespread\" disruption of routine childhood vaccinations in recent history, a new modeling study suggests., At least 17 million children worldwide missed routine vaccinations because of the pandemic, according to the study\'s estimates, published Wednesday in the journal The Lancet., Unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children are vulnerable to outbreaks of disease, and public health officials around the world are worried., \"Routine immunization services faced stark challenges in 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing the most widespread and largest global disruption in recent history,\" wrote the researchers, from the University of Washington in Seattle, the World Health Organization in Geneva and the Pan American Health Organization in Washington, DC., \"This analysis offers, to our knowledge, the first modeled assessments of global and regional disruptions to vaccination coverage, by month, during the COVID pandemic in 2020,\" the researchers wrote. , A global drop in routine vaccinations, The researchers analyzed immunization data from 1980 to 2019 to estimate how many routine vaccinations would have been expected for 2020 if the pandemic never happened -- and compared their models with actual data on vaccinations in 2020. The study included data on global mobility and routine immunization reports from last year., , The researchers found that, from January to December 2020, an estimated 30 million children who were eligible to receive the third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine and 27.2 million children eligible to receive the first dose of measles vaccine had missed those doses. The estimates represent about 8.5 million more children without DTP third doses and about 8.9 million more children without a dose of measles vaccine than were estimated to miss doses if the pandemic hadn\'t happened. , The researchers wrote that the reductions in vaccinations represented a 7.7% drop for DTP third doses and 7.9% drop for the first dose of measles vaccine. These disruptions in vaccinations impacted both high-income and low-income nations alike., The findings suggest that, among all regions, south Asia experienced the largest acute declines in vaccinations, with DTP third doses administered falling by 58% and measles first doses falling by 43% in April of last year. Since then, improvements occurred, with vaccinations in south Asia nearing what would have been expected if the pandemic hadn\'t happened by the end of 2020, the researchers found., , In the United States, and other high-income regions, estimated DTP third doses administered fell by 22% and the number of measles first doses fell by 20.5% in April of last year. Then vaccination rates appeared to partially recover through to December, with annual reductions of 6% for DTP third doses and 7.9% for measles first doses., Disruptions were most severe in April of last year across all regions, with the global number of doses administered falling by 31.3% for DTP third doses and by 30% for measles first doses, the researchers wrote. \"The second half of 2020 showed signs of recovery, as global monthly doses administered began nearing expected estimates by December, 2020. Nevertheless, recovery efforts were far from complete,\" they wrote., , The \"expected estimates\" for 2020 in the study are still only estimates that the researchers modeled after data from previous years -- as no one really knows how many vaccinations would have occurred last year if the pandemic hadn\'t happened., In a commentary that published alongside the study, Kaja Abbas of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Vittal Mogasale of the International Vaccine Instituted commended the new study\'s findings., \"These modeled estimates are of importance to national immunization programs for planning and implementing catch-up vaccination services to close the immunity gaps and prevent vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks,\" Abbas and Mogasale wrote. \"The urgent need for catch-up vaccination efforts is conspicuous for most contagious childhood diseases, including measles and pertussis.\", \'We have gone backwards on other vaccinations\', In separate data, the World Health Organization said Wednesday that 23 million children missed out on basic routine immunizations last year overall. That\'s 3.7 million more than in 2019, according to data released by WHO and UNICEF., \"Even as countries clamor to get their hands on COVID-19 vaccines, we have gone backwards on other vaccinations, leaving children at risk from devastating but preventable diseases like measles, polio or meningitis,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in the announcement., \"Multiple disease outbreaks would be catastrophic for communities and health systems already battling COVID-19, making it more urgent than ever to invest in childhood vaccination and ensure every child is reached.\", , Disruptions in immunization services were widespread last year, the announcement noted.  WHO said the 10 nations with the greatest increase in children not receiving a first dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine last year were: India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Philippines, Mexico, Mozambique, Angola, Tanzania, Argentina and Venezuela., Globally, as compared with 2019, 3.5 million more children last year missed their first doses of DTP vaccine and 3 million more children missed their first measles doses, according to WHO., \"Even before the pandemic, there were worrying signs that we were beginning to lose ground in the fight to immunize children against preventable child illness, including with the widespread measles outbreaks two years ago,\" Henrietta Fore, UNICEF\'s executive director, said. , \"The pandemic has made a bad situation worse,\" Fore said. \"With the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines at the forefront of everyone\'s minds, we must remember that vaccine distribution has always been inequitable, but it does not have to be.\", Kids have yet to catch up, The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has raised alarm that children in the United States have yet to catch up on their routine immunizations., , A reported published by the CDC in June found that administered vaccine doses of routine childhood immunizations dropped substantially from March through May last year, and although administered doses later increased from June through September, that increase \"was not sufficient to achieve catch-up coverage.\", The report warns that the \"lag in catch-up vaccination might pose a serious public health threat that would result in vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, especially in schools that have reopened for in-person learning.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/health/children-routine-vaccinations-pandemic-study-wellness/index.html',1,118),(91,'Dr. Sanjay Gupta: The importance of being vaccinated','We\'ve all heard it said over and over again: We\'re now in the phase of the pandemic when it\'s a race between vaccinations and the variants. It has been neck and neck for a while, and honestly, I was ready to cheer a vaccine victory. We nearly dropped to an average of fewer than 10,000 new cases a day, an important number because, according to President Joe Biden\'s chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, that number moves the country into \"containment\" -- a time when we would finally get our arms around the spread. We came tantalizingly close: 11,299 cases in late June. , But, then the variants caught some speed, and the vaccine started to fall behind; we are now at an average of 23,472 new cases a day as of Tuesday, and all indications point to that number rising. There are many countries around the world that now are seeing case rates increase against a backdrop of sparse vaccine supply. Here in the United States, we have plenty of vaccine available, a precious commodity almost every country around the world wishes they had. We have the means to distribute vaccines and have even made them totally free of charge. , I believe most of us also fundamentally understand the best way to get a handle on the pandemic and return fully to life as we know it is to vaccinate enough people. What we are lacking is the will., It may be that some parts of the country really haven\'t gotten the memo on the importance of vaccines -- or even worse, they are receiving another far more insidious message: that it\'s the vaccines themselves that are the problem., They aren\'t the problem. They are our best shot at being rescued from this ongoing pandemic. Research from the Commonwealth Fund estimates the Covid-19 vaccines have already saved about 280,000 lives and averted up to 1.25 million hospitalizations in the United States. A vaccine protects not only the person getting it but those around them as well -- including children under the age of 12, for whom the current coronavirus vaccines are not yet authorized, or those who have weakened immune systems that prevent their bodies from generating a strong immune response after vaccination. , That is the very definition of herd immunity: providing a ring of protection around the vulnerable. In order to get there, around 70% of people need to be fully vaccinated. That level of immunity will make it so that we are no longer such willing hosts to the virus and put us on a path to eventually run it out of town., The vaccines also directly protect us from future variants; mutated versions of the virus that emerge in infected people and can be more contagious than the original strain. Right now, it\'s the Delta variant that is wreaking havoc in the United States and elsewhere, but the more the virus spreads, the higher the chances another variant of concern will take its place. Vaccinations slow these mutations from happening because if a person doesn\'t get infected in the first place, their body can\'t possibly become a breeding ground for a mutation.,  A look at the numbers, President Joe Biden set what initially appeared to be an attainable goal: have 70% of the adult population with at least one Covid-19 vaccine shot by July 4th. But after months of steady vaccine progress, the numbers began to dwindle and the goal was missed. , Currently about 59% of the US population has at least one dose and 48% is fully vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But that doesn\'t tell the full story. The United States cannot be painted with a single brush stroke, and nowhere is that more true than with this pandemic. As things stand now, the top five states have 60% or more of their population fully vaccinated versus less than 36% for the bottom five states. , According to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University and the CDC, states that have fully vaccinated more than half of their residents reported an average of 2.8 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people each day last week, compared to an average of about 7.8 cases per 100,000 people each day in states that have vaccinated fewer than half of their residents. That\'s almost a three-fold difference. It\'s in those states with the highest vaccination rates where you can see the vaccines truly work their magic. It\'s not just cases decreasing, but more importantly, hospitalizations and deaths plummeting as well. The vaccines accomplished exactly what they were designed to do. , Early data from a number of states suggests that 99.5% of those Covid-19 deaths during the first six months of the year have been in unvaccinated people. Just consider that if a patient in the United States is hospitalized or dies of Covid, 99 times out of 100 they are unvaccinated. Dying at this stage in the pandemic is almost like a soldier dying after a peace treaty has been signed. Heartbreaking and largely preventable. , CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky called any suffering or death from Covid-19 \"tragic,\" and noted that available vaccines mean that \"the suffering and loss we are now seeing is nearly entirely avoidable.\", \"We have seen the successes of our vaccination program over the last eight months with cases, hospitalizations and deaths far lower than the peaks we saw in January,\" she said. \"And yet on the other hand, we are starting to see some new and concerning trends.\" , One of those trends is the falling rate of vaccination. An average of 282,143 people are reaching \"fully vaccinated\" status each day -- one of the lowest daily rates since the end of January, when vaccination efforts were just picking up steam. And it\'s almost a 50% drop from last week, when an average of about 535,000 people became fully vaccinated each day. At our peak in mid-April, an average of nearly 1.8 million people -- more than six times as many -- were becoming fully vaccinated every day., The wrath of Delta, Another new and concerning trend involves the rise of the Delta variant, which is believed to be much more contagious; it now makes up more than 50% of Covid-19 cases in the US -- and in some places, that number tops 80%. Its dominance is making the vaccination issue even more pressing., Fauci called it \"a real bad actor virus\" on CBS earlier this week., The Delta variant, first identified in India, is likely behind the current uptick in cases. The US is now averaging more than 23,000 new Covid-19 cases each day, according to Johns Hopkins University, almost double two weeks ago. The average number of daily cases is rising in 46 states. And we\'re seeing 261 new Covid-19 deaths each day -- a 21% increase from last week. Again, deaths that are largely preventable., How contagious is the Delta variant? If you remember back to the start of the pandemic, we measured how infectious a communicable disease is using a mathematical term called R0 (R-nought), also called the reproduction number. It basically estimates the average number of people one infected individual will go on to infect. If the R0 number falls below 1, the disease eventually dies out., According to estimates, the original virus found in Wuhan, China had an R0 between 2.4 and 2.6. The Alpha variant, which had been the dominant variant and was first identified in the United Kingdom, was between 4 and 5. The Delta variant\'s reproduction number is estimated to be somewhere between 5 and 8. , That means the Delta variant is estimated to be two to three times more contagious than the original virus first seen in Wuhan, Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said via email. , What does that look like in real life? Unforgiving. A remarkable look at CCTV footage from Australia revealed a simple encounter between two people passing each other at an indoor shopping area that resulted in two separate instances of transmission. The encounter was brief. The premier of New South Wales, where the incidents occurred, even called it \"scarily fleeting.\" , That is why the rise of the Delta variant coupled with low vaccination areas is really worrying public health experts, just as they were ready to start looking at Covid in the rear view mirror., A new data analysis by researchers at Georgetown University has now identified 30 clusters of counties with low vaccination rates and significant population sizes that are vulnerable to surges in Covid-19 cases and could become breeding grounds for even more deadly Covid-19 variants. The five most significant clusters are sprawled across large swaths of the southeastern United States and a smaller portion in the Midwest. No surprise, most are already seeing increases in Covid-19 cases. , \"We can\'t have it both ways; we can\'t be both unmasked and unvaccinated. That won\'t work,\" Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a CNN medical analyst and professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University, said Monday. , Or as Dr. Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the NIAID and one of the developers of the Moderna vaccine, told me: The country will no longer be split into vaccinated and unvaccinated; it will simply be split into vaccinated and infected. , That\'s where this road leads. , How to unstick the stuck vax rate, The simple answer is: Get vaccinated. You know that by now, and again, most people do. The doctors, nurses and health care teams recommending this are not political, but I can understand why you might think otherwise lately.  , During the Conservative Political Action Conference\'s summer gathering in Dallas last weekend, attendees cheered author Alex Berenson when he pointed out that the Biden administration fell short of its vaccination goal. , At least 34 states as of June have introduced bills that would limit requiring someone to demonstrate their vaccination status or immunity against Covid-19 in certain areas such as workplaces or government buildings, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures; 13 of those bills have passed into law. That includes at least seven states -- Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Montana, Oklahoma and Utah -- that enacted legislation this year that would restrict public schools from requiring either coronavirus vaccinations or documentation of vaccination status.  , And in Tennessee Dr. Michelle Fiscus, a pediatrician who has served as the state\'s medical director of the vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization for two years, says she was fired after she shared information about a decades-old state policy that allowed some teens to be immunized without parental consent.  , Vaccine benefits outweigh risks, It\'s true that there have been a few concerning possible side effects associated with the vaccines. They include reports of a rare neurological condition called Guillain-Barré syndrome developing in some who received the Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s vaccine as well as reports of rare blood clots in others; and heart inflammation in a small number of people who received Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines.  , While these are all serious conditions, it\'s important to remember these events are very, very rare occurrences out of the almost 185 million people who have received at least one shot in this country. And it\'s reassuring to know that in the vast majority of cases, those who developed these side effects recovered. The same can\'t be said for Covid-19, which has killed more than 607,000 people in this country, caused almost 34 million infections, and can cause symptoms that linger long after the person has \"recovered.\" , It\'s also true there have been breakthrough cases of Covid-19 among the fully vaccinated, but that is to be expected. Even if an infection occurs, the important thing to remember is that the vaccines offer excellent protection against severe disease and death -- the two most important outcomes. And that\'s true even for the Delta variant, according to recent data from Israel and the United Kingdom., Some progress is being made. A new poll released Tuesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that about 20% of Americans who were initially hesitant about or squarely against getting the Covid-19 vaccine have since gotten their shots. Of course, seen from the glass-half-empty perspective, that means 80% haven\'t.,  Convincing most unvaccinated Americans to get their shots will take more time than initial phases of vaccinations, White House Covid-19 chief Jeff Zients told reporters at a Covid-19 response team briefing earlier in the month., \"Each person in this phase will take longer to reach, but that makes them no less important. And the spread of the Delta variant, which poses a particular threat to our young people, only strengthens our resolve to reach everyone,\" he said., That\'s an effort I am 100% behind.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/health/covid-vaccine-solution-not-problem-gupta/index.html',1,119),(92,'In rural Georgia, a door-to-door push to get neighbors vaccinated against Covid-19','If it were the fall, this group of volunteers -- folders in hand, walking shoes on their feet -- would be knocking on doors to get out the vote in rural Cuthbert, Georgia.As they walked in the hot spring sun this April and May, these four have another mission.

In the early months of the pandemic, it had the highest Covid-19 case rate in the state., Randolph is also one of the poorest counties in Georgia, and isolated -- nearly 140 miles south of Atlanta and more than an hour\'s drive from a major highway. It\'s the top wheat and sorghum grower in the state, and its county seat, Cuthbert, population about 3,500, is home to the private liberal arts school Andrew College., Nearly 62% of Randolph County\'s population is Black, and it sits in the heart of the historic Black Belt, the string of counties in the Deep South that includes some of the poorest and most rural regions of the country, all with large Black communities. , The county\'s racial demographics alone make residents more susceptible to severe disease from the coronavirus. And according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people who live in rural areas face an increased risk of hospitalization and death from Covid-19. , But in Randolph County, the vaccination rate is well below the state average -- and Georgia\'s rate is among the lowest in the country., That\'s not just a problem for Randolph County and other rural places where vaccines have been slow to take off. Lagging vaccination rates in rural areas could extend the pandemic for the entire country, according to CDC researchers., The Biden administration\'s goal is to give 70% of US adults at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose by July 4, and last week it launched its latest push to draw in the unvaccinated. The federal government is trying to woo people by putting vaccines in community hubs like barber shops; making plans to offer child care; and by organizing rides to vaccination sites. Around the country, incentives are being offered, including beer, guns, scholarships and million dollar prizes., But the volunteers in Randolph County didn\'t want to wait for help or incentives. They\'ve been tapping on doors in support of Covid-19 vaccines since March., \'What are you waiting for?\', This group learned their canvassing skills in the political arena. They\'ve volunteered for years with the Randolph County Democratic Committee, which operates a community program, Neighbor 2 Neighbor. Earlier this year, the group wanted to build on momentum from the 2020 election, and launched the program\'s nonpartisan vaccine effort., At first, it focused on seniors who didn\'t have the internet access needed to get vaccine appointments with the county health department. Since then, volunteers have expanded their targets and knocked on hundreds of doors., Just like when they canvass to get out the vote, the volunteers are prepared with answers to questions., Some who come to the door say they\'ve heard the Covid-19 vaccines cause infertility. Barlow, a canvasser and nurse, fields that one -- she explains that it doesn\'t affect fertility, and she can share the research to make it clear., \"Some tell us it\'s of the devil,\" Barlow says. With religious objections, canvassers talk about how God inspired scientists to make the vaccines. Sometimes the volunteers attend the same church as the person they\'re canvassing, and can name fellow church members who\'ve already been vaccinated. , If people say they don\'t trust government, or vaccines were developed too quickly, \"we listen to people\'s concerns and then try to help educate them and give them food for thought,\" Barlow said. \"If they still say that they want to wait and see, I listen, but it\'s kind of baffling, because I always ask, \'What are you waiting for? To see how well things are going to go? We already know that. They go well when people are protected.\' \"  , Not all residents in rural Randolph County are hesitant to get vaccinated., While many vaccine appointments are available online, about a third of residents in Randolph County don\'t have home internet, according to Census figures. , The median household income here is half the amount of Georgia\'s, with a third of the county below the poverty line. Some may not realize Covid-19 vaccines are free and insurance isn\'t required, and it can be hard to get time off from work or secure child care. , Randolph County has the highest percentage of households in the state without access to a vehicle -- almost 20% -- according to Census estimates analyzed by the CDC. That can make it hard to get to an appointment., To take on issues of access, the Neighbor 2 Neighbor volunteers organized their own Covid-19 vaccine clinic for April and May with the help of a local doctor. , When deciding where to put the clinic, they chose a central, walkable location and provided transportation, if needed. They signed people up for the clinic as they knocked on doors -- no internet required., \"We do this for each other because otherwise, the county just doesn\'t have the manpower to vaccinate residents quickly here,\" said Bobby Jenkins Jr., a vaccine canvasser and chair of the local Democratic Committee. \"We don\'t want to let anything stand in the way of getting people protected.\" , Canvasser Sandra Willis poses a question to Shingles, the man who answered the door one day this spring: \"Sherod, why haven\'t you gotten your vaccine yet?\", Shingles says he simply hasn\'t gotten around to getting vaccinated. Still standing in his front yard, the group makes a plan., \"We\'ll be calling you on Saturday to make sure you can come to our clinic that day,\" Willis tells Shingles, knowing from experience that effective persuasion often requires follow-up. , \"Sherod, you\'re going to be the first one I give the vaccine to,\" Barlow, the nurse, teased, saying, \"Looking at your shoulders, it will be real easy.\" , Making a way out of no way, It seems everyone in Randolph County has a story of someone who died or was seriously ill from Covid-19. , , One of the canvassers, Willis, says her brother caught Covid-19 at a nursing home that lost many residents. He pulled through, but Willis also lost one of her best friends and a pastor she knew. They were two among hundreds of cases in the region connected to a couple large funerals that became superspreader events in February 2020. With area hospitals overwhelmed at the time, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp sent the National Guard to help. , The volunteers have a sense of urgency around vaccination against Covid-19: If people in Randolph County do get seriously ill, finding care is difficult. , In October, the county\'s only hospital closed. It had struggled financially for years, but the pandemic put \"the nail in the coffin,\" hospital CEO Kim Gilman said., The county has only one ambulance to cover 431 square miles. The nearest hospital now is a 45-minute drive, and to get to the nearest ER, these Georgia residents have to go to Alabama. , At the closing ceremony for the hospital in October, a minister said they have to push forward and \"make a way out of no way.\" , So for these volunteers, their way is organizing their own vaccine clinic and spreading the word door to door. , Out canvassing the unvaccinated one day this spring, the group leaves a flier at a house with a handwritten sign that says, \"Because of the coronavirus NO visitors until further notice. THANKS!!!\", But from next door, Tiffany Barnes pokes her head out to see what\'s going on. , \"How y\'all doing?\" Barnes asks, a shaking chihuahua named Cisco tucked under her arm. , Barlow waves a flier at Barnes. \"We are canvassing to make sure people know about our vaccine clinic. Do you have yours?\" Barlow asks. , Barnes has not. She signs up immediately, promising to bring her mother, too. , \"We will happily take care of you both,\" Barlow tells her. \"You can bring Cisco too. We can\'t vaccinate him, but he\'d be great company.\" , As they take down her information. Barnes thanks them for their efforts. , \"It\'s a real blessing that you are actually going around door-to-door, getting people to sign up,\" Barnes says. , \"That\'s what this is all about. Neighbor to neighbor. As soon as we get herd, or community immunity for all our neighbors, then it will be safe for all of us to go out. I know everybody\'s been cooped up,\" Barlow tells her. \"We want to get everyone protected. We are, after all, our brother\'s and sister\'s keepers.\" , At the clinic that Saturday, the volunteers were able to vaccinate 80 people with the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine -- including those they met going door to door.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/06/health/rural-vaccination-randolph-county-georgia/index.html',1,120),(93,'Our dreams are changing as we emerge from the pandemic. Here\'s how','If you thought living through the pandemic was a waking nightmare, just imagine what it\'s been like in dreams. Many of us experienced vivid, frightening nightmares throughout the worst of the pandemic. Depending on our level of trauma -- the loss of a loved one or being a health care worker on front lines of Covid-19-packed intensive care units -- the bad dreams could be excruciating., Psychologist Deirdre Barrett has been collecting our dreams and nightmares since the virus shut down our lives. Many of our night visions revolved around the fear of death, as our subconscious ruminated on the very real threat of Covid-19. Other dreams cast the virus as an invasive predator, often an insect., \"There were grasshoppers with vampire fangs, masses of wiggling worms, swarms of flying bugs which could be bees or flies or hornets, and armies of cockroaches racing at the dreamer,\" said Barrett, an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School who has authored and edited numerous books on dreams, including Pandemic Dreams., Women were especially hard-hit, Barrett found. One dreamer wandered \"into a mortuary which she gradually discovers is embalming live COVID patients,\" Barrett wrote in a paper published on the topic., Barrett is continuing to follow pandemic dreams. She has collected from at least 76 countries more than 14,000 dreams, two-thirds of which are from the United States. In her ongoing analysis of the data, she has seen a change in the content of our dreams since vaccinations began and states and local communities have begun to reopen., CNN spoke to her about the types of nightmares we\'ve had during the pandemic and how they have evolved over time. The conversation has been lightly edited for clarity., CNN: How can dreams provide insights into our lives during the pandemic?, Deirdre Barrett: Dreaming is just thinking in a really different brain state. There\'s a lot of research on what\'s called the consistency hypothesis of dreams, which has been pretty well proven: The more somebody thinks about certain topics by day, the more it\'s going to turn up in their dreams at night. , But in the brain state we\'re in during dreaming, visual areas are very active, the areas that tell stories are active and emotional areas are active, whereas verbal areas and logic are less active than usual., We\'re thinking about all of our usual thoughts and concerns, but we\'re thinking about them in very vivid, visual, narrative or storytelling ways. Dreams may be more emotional, less logical, but the basic content still maps on very closely., CNN: Why did you start collecting dreams from the pandemic?, Barrett: In addition to my work on dreams and how they contribute to creativity and objective problem solving, I\'ve done several studies on dreams during crises or traumas. I did a survey of dreams after 9/11 and dreams in Kuwait during the first Gulf War, both during the occupation and shortly after. And I stumbled upon an archive of 500 dreams from prisoners of war in a Nazi POW camp in World War II that no one had examined. , It just seemed it would be interesting to see how the dreams during the pandemic resembled past crises. I put a global survey up on March 23, 2020, and there were some nightmares I saw from the start in other parts of the world that only turned up in the US later. , For example, in Italy where the virus hit early and hard, health care professionals were having these classic post-traumatic dreams in which someone was dying in front of them, and they thought it was their responsibility to save them and they couldn\'t. I didn\'t see any of those in the US for another two to three weeks, when cases in New York City started to climb., Dreams like \"Oops, I don\'t have my mask on\" or \"Other people won\'t wear their masks and I\'m in danger\" -- I saw those from Asia right at the start, but they didn\'t begin in the US until health care professionals told us to begin wearing masks., I saw very similar dreams everywhere around the world, but for the most part the timing matched when the Covid-19 outbreaks were the worst in that region or when guidelines to the public changed. , CNN: How have our dreams changed this year compared to 2020?, Barrett:  As the world began to open, there have been some fairly large changes in the proportion of dreams that people are reporting. For starters, I started seeing more positive, optimistic dreams. , These upbeat dreams tend to be about being back in some big, crowded social situation doing a favorite activity, such as dancing at a nightclub or being at a sporting event or being at family reunion with lots of family that actually live all over the country. , Dreams like that were pretty rare in the early weeks of the pandemic, and when people did dream like that they tended to remark that they woke up and felt this wave of sadness. They felt as if the dream had been taunting them with something that they could no longer do -- like they were seeing something from their past that was not in their foreseeable future. , But beginning mid-December of 2020, when it was announced the vaccines were highly effective and were being given emergency use approval, positive dreams started increasing. , It was also really striking that the dream could be the same as from earlier months of the pandemic, but now people said they woke up happy. The dream had cheered them up because they felt their dream was foretelling a future in which everything was going to go well., CNN: You mentioned in your paper that women carried the brunt of nightmares during the pandemic. Why?, Barrett: When I began the study on pandemic dreams, I predicted an increase in negative emotions and references to illness, death and the physical body. I compared the dream data I got to a huge pool of dreams that had been collected during a quiet time before the pandemic. , What I found was that both men and women\'s pandemic dreams had two and a half times greater anxiety, twice the reference to illness, and four times the reference to death than dreams captured before the pandemic., But it was only for women that the other negative emotions like sadness and anger were were elevated. They were almost twice as high for women, but men\'s dreams showed no more anger or sadness than before. , I was a little surprised when I first got that result, but when I read the dreams more closely I found that bad dreams about homeschooling were almost all from mothers, rather than fathers, and there were many female dreams about how to take care of children or how to nurse sick people., Another category that was elevated one and a half times in women were mentions of body parts, such as fingers, hands, arms, toes, feet, legs torso, breasts and genitals., I thought that would be connected to illness, but often the dream would be \"roommate is looking at this or that body part.\" And I realized there\'s been increased reports of domestic abuse and sexual violence in the home during the pandemic and an increase of unwanted sexual approaches from platonic roommates. So it seemed the dreams were reflecting problems that may be unique or more often experienced by women., CNN: Are any dream topics reported during the pandemic continuing?, Barrett: People have continued to dream about masks -- it\'s a commonly reported dream -- but there\'s a subtle change. In the early days, it was always a fearful dream. , \"I forgot my mask\" or \"My mask fell off\" or \"My mask is disintegrating in some magical way\" -- those were about half of the mask dreams. The other half were: \"I\'m around other people who don\'t have a mask;\" or \"They don\'t have it on properly;\" or \"Their mask has holes in it.\", In those early pandemic mask dreams, the dreamer would panic, and struggle to get further away from people because they were afraid of catching Covid-19. Definitely fear was the the main emotion., By early last fall, however, instead of fear and contagion being the issue when the dreamer realized that they didn\'t have a mask on, it would be shame or social embarrassment or \"What will people think of me that I\'m not wearing a mask?\", Those fall into a more traditional dream metaphor of social shame, when people are out in a mall and suddenly realize they have forgotten their clothing. It really looks to me like these mask dreams have temporarily replaced the \"naked in public\" dream that lots of people have., That\'s been a really interesting change, and I will be curious to see how long it lasts., CNN: Based on your knowledge of trauma and nightmares, what do you expect to happen to pandemic dreams?, Barrett: What we know is that when people experienced the same traumatic event, many will dream about it shortly after it happens. Then, if you\'re looking at the group average, it drops off over time and dreams about the event just disappear for more than half the people. , Doctors don\'t diagnose post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) until it\'s been going on a certain amount of time, and it\'s not considered a disorder to have the heightened startle response or daytime flashbacks or nightmares if they happen in the immediate aftermath. It\'s a very normal post-trauma response to have nightmares about the event for a little while, and then most people adapt. , However, some people will continue to struggle and possibly develop long-term trauma dreams, such as people that are most directly affected by the event and suffered severe trauma. That group also includes people who already have anxiety disorders and people who have suffered some earlier trauma in their history. , After 9/11, people who had the worst nightmares were in the building and barely got out, the first responders, and people who worked close enough to see scenes of bodies falling. Many of the worst nightmares I\'ve received during the pandemic are from nurses and doctors on the front lines., Other people can also developed long-term trauma dreams, such as people who were badly abused as a child, women who have been raped and combat veterans. This happens even in people who have not been continuing to have recurring nightmares about the earlier trauma. , A new trauma, even one experienced secondhand, comes along and gets a lot of news attention and that can activate dreams about the early trauma or the recent one, or even a hybrid of both traumas in the same nightmare., I would say its going to be people who had the most direct experience with death and dying, those who are physiologically vulnerable to anxiety, stress and trauma, and those who have had prior trauma who are likely to have the longest struggle with nightmares.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/health/dreams-pandemic-opening-wellness/index.html',1,122),(94,'With the return of in-person reunions, the return of toxic family relationships too','During the pandemic, I was working with an adult female client to resolve a number of unanticipated family issues: a son who worked too little in his Zoom-based classes, clashes with her husband about financial concerns and how much time to spend together as a family at home. We all faced unanticipated family issues within our households throughout the pandemic: managing time with significant others, getting our kids to listen, reasoning with a family member who refuses to get vaccinated, minding the emotional temperature of a home already stressed out., What we need to avoid, As awful as the pandemic was, it did afford us the luxury of avoiding some long-standing family problems such as grandparents who disapprove of our parenting styles or an adult sibling we just cannot stand for his politics or narcissism., Pre-pandemic, these are the types of relationship issues many of my clients were working through. But during Covid, many didn\'t have to see those difficult family members, and in many cases the conflict seemed to disappear altogether., Now those family issues are back., In just the past few weeks, I\'m seeing those negative family members come back into my clients\' lives with a vengeance. As families are getting together again across the United States, the judgments and personality clashes that have been put on hold are re-emerging, often with renewed energy., As it turns out, pre-pandemic family patterns were firmly set and highly resistant to change. Those conflicts and grudges never really disappeared. They just faded into the background, ready to reemerge at a moment\'s notice. , Many of my clients are upset by this turn of events. They thought they were finally free from their family turmoil, only to have it return post-pandemic. Now they are more angry and frustrated about the same stale topics. And for those who do the heavy emotional lifting for our families, their burden has grown quite a bit, and quickly., Boundaries might be part of the new normal, There is one change since before the pandemic: I\'m hearing my clients say they are no longer willing to stick with the pre-pandemic status quo, instead setting more clear, firm boundaries to protect themselves emotionally. , I work with a woman in her 40s who has struggled in her relationship with her mother since her teen years. She describes her mother as judgmental, remote and emotionally unavailable. She felt a reprieve from these feelings in her brief but pleasant exchanges with her mother during the pandemic. But once they sat across from one another again, maskless and close, the toxicity rapidly returned., In therapy, we discovered she had some agency in this relationship she did not realize she possessed before Covid-19. She had choices. She could let her mother know that, once she said something offensive, she would leave. She could make certain topics off-limits. She could set boundaries. , In any toxic family relationships you have, you can do the same. You can\'t change other people, but you can choose not to see them anymore or to see them far less. You can get off the phone or leave when offended. You can decide that no overnights are allowed. And with clear, non-negotiable boundaries, that relational pain truly can be mitigated., Setting clear boundaries is neither a concession nor a punishment. Instead, it provides structure around a difficult relationship. That clarity may preserve a relationship that would be otherwise irreparable. The mother of the woman cited above, for instance, responded very well to the boundaries my client set. And setting boundaries works not only in family relationships, but in most any connection we have that unnecessarily drains us of our precious emotional energy., The bottom line, Before you go to back to the same patterns, take a moment to consider your family relationships. The pandemic allowed us to step back and take stock of how we spend our time, and who we spend time with. , , We recognize toxicity in our relationships more clearly. And we have an opportunity to act on it before our negative pre-pandemic patterns return. , During this post-pandemic period, I strongly encourage you to take stock of your extended family relationships and consider which bring you energy and which drain you. For the latter group, set overt, clear boundaries now, before those well-rehearsed patterns re-establish themselves.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/health/toxic-family-relationships-wellness/index.html',1,124),(95,'Covid-19 cases are surging in 46 states. In one hot spot, hospitalized patients are younger than ever, doctor says','Just as health expertsIn 46 states, the rates of new cases this past week are at least 10% higher than the rates of new cases the previous week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. , In 31 states, new cases this past week are at least 50% higher than new cases the previous week., , The vast majority of new Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths have one thing in common: They\'re among unvaccinated people, doctors say. , More than 99% of all Covid-19 deaths in June were among unvaccinated people, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., And younger people are getting hospitalized with Covid-19., Missouri has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country and one of the worst outbreaks of the Delta variant. The situation is so bad in Missouri that the United States deployed a surge team to help stop the spread -- including members from the CDC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. , Springfield emergency physician Dr. Howard Jarvis said the Covid-19 patients he\'s seeing are younger than ever. And all the Covid-19 patients admitted to his hospital during this surge have not been vaccinated. , \"If they\'re sick enough to be admitted to the hospital, they are unvaccinated. That is the absolute common denominator amongst those patients,\" he said. , \"Earlier in the pandemic, and certainly before we had vaccinations, we were seeing a much older patient population in the emergency department and getting admitted to the hospital,\" Jarvis said. , \"In recent weeks, we\'ve been seeing a much younger population,\" he said. \"We\'re seeing a lot of people in their 30s, 40s, early 50s. We\'re seeing some teenagers and some pediatric patients as well.\", In St. Louis County, officials said the rate of new cases jumped by 63% over the past two weeks., \"A tidal wave is coming towards our unvaccinated populations,\" County Executive Sam Page said., \"This variant is spreading quickly, and this variant has the ability to devastate those in its wake. And that is why it is so critical to get vaccinated now.\", The choice unvaccinated Americans face , If unvaccinated Americans want to stave off the Delta variant but don\'t want to wear masks, the choice is simple: Get vaccinated, said Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University., \"We can\'t have it both ways. We can\'t be both unmasked and non-socially distant and unvaccinated. That won\'t work,\" he said. , \"We have the tools to put this down -- we can put it down this summer -- but the way to do that is vaccination.\", Some don\'t want to be vaccinated because of popular myths and concerns about the Covid-19 vaccines. , And recent news about Guillain-Barré syndrome has led to some concern on social media. The neurological condition has been reported in about 0.0008% of the people who have received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. , It\'s not clear whether those cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome resulted from the vaccine. , Of the 12.8 million Americans who have received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, about 100 cases of GBS have been reported, the US Food and Drug Administration said., \"Each year in the United States, an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people develop GBS,\" the FDA said. \"Most people fully recover from the disorder.\", In Arkansas, which has been hit hard by the Delta variant, Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. said he was very reluctant to get vaccinated. He\'s never even gotten a flu shot before, the mayor told CNN., But after researching the facts about Covid-19 and the vaccines, he said, he changed his mind., \"Being a Black man and understanding the Tuskegee experiment and the amount of distrust that comes from the Black community as well as the Latino community, it felt like I definitely had to lead the way to ensure that all residents went out and took the shot,\" Scott said. , \"I did the research and understood the facts,\" said the mayor, who is now vaccinated. \"It\'s serious, and we should not have to allow someone to die for us to really believe the research and science.\", In Mississippi, the state health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, said seven children are in intensive care -- and two of them are on ventilators -- due to the surge.  , is not immediately clear how these hospitalizations compare with previous surges in Mississippi.  , On Monday, Dobbs tweeted: \"Pretty much ALL cases in MS are Delta variant right now,\" adding that the vast majority of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the last month were among those who are unvaccinated., Only a quarter of kids 12 to 15 are vaccinated, Children ages 12 to 15 became eligible to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine two months ago, but only a quarter of them are fully vaccinated -- less than any other age group. , Among teens ages 16 and 17, about 37% are fully vaccinated., The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is the only one authorized for adolescents ages 12 to 17. , And with school starting in just a few weeks for many students, parents who want their children vaccinated must act soon because it takes five weeks for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to fully kick in.

But as more vaccines are administered, social restrictions are getting relaxed -- and some people seem to be ready to make up for lost time by embracing their \"hot vax summer.\", Male condom sales shot up 23.4% to $37 million during the four weeks ending April 18, compared to the same stretch in 2020, according to market research firm IRI. That increase followed a 4.4% drop in all of 2020., But while many see the further reopening of the economy as a sign that Covid-19 is less of a health crisis, there are other viruses and bacteria out there -- such as those that are sexually transmitted. And physicians warn a rise in STD cases is on the way. But that\'s not just because vaccinated singles are ready to mingle again., Rates were already rising, , Reported STDs in the United States reached an all-time high for the sixth consecutive year in 2019, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with more than 2.5 million cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis reported., These reportable STDs increased by nearly 30% between 2015 and 2019, the agency said., Experts told CNN these worrisome trends can be tied to several factors., Dr. Hunter Handsfield, a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD, told CNN one of those could be that people are using condoms less. He said this applies particularly to men who have sex with men because they see that layer of protection, plus selecting uninfected partners, as less important now that there are more tools to prevent HIV,  specifically, pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP -- pills people at high risk can take to prevent infection., There are also changed attitudes about sexuality., \"People currently in their teens and 20s, I think, there are different attitudes and beliefs about what constitutes a committed relationship and what doesn\'t,\" Handsfield said., Additionally, there are more resources to meet sexual partners, including dating apps, which have less of a stigma compared to years past., The CDC notes high infection levels can also be impacted by obstacles to prevention and care, such as poverty, unstable housing or lack of a medical home., Add a pandemic that requires health care systems to reallocate staff from STD prevention to helping fight a deadly respiratory virus and these problems get exacerbated., Numbers don\'t tell the whole story, The CDC says preliminary 2020 data suggest many of these concerning trends continued into 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted STD testing and treatment services., A CDC study published in the Journal of the American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association in June gives the first preliminary findings of the national impact of Covid-19 on STDs in 2020, with data through December of last year., The analysis found while reported STDs dramatically decreased during March and April of 2020, some appeared to resurge by the end of the year., As of December 12, the cumulative totals for 2020 compared to 2019 showed gonorrhea case counts were 7% higher, chlamydia case numbers were 14% lower and numbers of syphilis cases (primary &amp; secondary) were 1% lower., In a September press briefing, Dr. Hilary Reno, a medical consultant with the Division of STD Prevention at the CDC, detailed how the pandemic led to a dramatic drop in STD testing last year. , BJC HealthCare, one of the main hospitals in the St. Louis metro region, saw testing decline after the first positive Covid-19 case in March, Reno said. After the city issued stay-at-home orders, testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia dropped 45%. Reno added this amounted to about 4,400 missed gonorrhea and chlamydia tests in a 10-week period in this region., HIV testing had a similar pattern, with an estimated 5,000 missed tests in the same period, Reno said., Handsfield told CNN it is difficult to know for sure what really happened to the number of STD cases during the peak of the pandemic., \"The notion that there is a risk that they will rebound, to me, makes a certain amount of sense. But it\'s with that caveat that we really don\'t know very well how to interpret the data behind those observations,\" Handsfield said., Testing also may have increased pre-pandemic., Dr. Kees Rietmeijer, former director of the STD Control Program at the Denver Public Health Department, pointed out to CNN that, like Covid-19, \"the more you test, the more you find.\" But unlike coronavirus cases, the number of negative STD tests is not reported, so the positivity rate isn\'t known., Not all sex stopped, One way sexually transmitted infections are like Covid-19 is that many cases are asymptomatic, said Dr. Julie Dombrowski, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Washington who also does research on HIV and STI clinical and public health services., That means the decrease in testing resulted in a number of STDs that went undetected and untreated, which presumably led to some ongoing transmission, Dombrowski told CNN. She noted chlamydia is especially an issue in this case, as it is usually asymptomatic and can lead to infertility and other reproductive issues., And while some people may have been less sexually active during the pandemic, not all sex stopped, so those pre-pandemic infections didn\'t just disappear., Dr. Edward Hook, a professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told CNN part of maintaining sexual health is realizing these infections are more common than many people think., \"Nobody wants to think they\'ve got a sexually transmitted infection or going to get one,\" he said., Rietmeijer echoed Hook, pointing out that the approach to treating STDs has focused on the clinical aspect, rather than the individual and societal impacts, such as inequity in health care and a stigma that can hinder people from taking preventative measures seriously., A National Academies of Sciences, Engineering Medicine report, which Hook and Rietmeijer worked on, said \"the national response to STIs must also consider the root causes of poor health,\" which range from racism and poverty to social stigma., A lack of timely diagnosis or preventative measures can lead to dangerous consequences. , For example, human papillomavirus (HPV), can cause cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, and cancers of the anus and penis., The good news is, STDs are preventable and treatable., Preventative measures, , Vaccines are recommended for protection against hepatitis B and HPV. The HPV vaccine is recommended for preteens ages 11 or 12 and everyone through age 26, though it\'s approved for anyone through age 45. The hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for infants at birth, with the series of shots being completed at 6 months. It\'s also recommended for certain unvaccinated adults, such as those with sexual partners who have hepatitis B., The CDC recommends everyone from ages 13 to 64 be tested at least once for HIV. But people at higher risk, which includes men who have sex with men, should get tested more often. Those men should get tested every three to six months. Anyone else who has unsafe sex should get tested for HIV at least once a year., All sexually active women younger than 25 years should be tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia every year, according to the agency\'s guidance. All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B starting early in pregnancy. All men who have sex with men should be tested at least once a year for syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea. (You can look for a place to get tested near you with the CDC\'s GetTested tool.), Hook said another element of maintaining good sexual health involves having a conversation with sexual partners., \"Hopefully people are interested in each other\'s health as well as their own,\" he said. \"Increasingly, although not increasingly enough, we are seeing and we continue to encourage couples who are thinking about or planning to initiate sexual activity, or even couples who have just recently begun sexual activity together, to go together to be screened for STIs.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/health/std-sti-spike-summer-2021-trnd/index.html',1,126),(97,'COVAX signs deal for 550 million Chinese Covid-19 vaccines amid questions over efficacy','COVAX has signed agreements with two Chinese pharmaceutical companies to buy more than half a billion of their Covid-19 vaccines by the first half of next year, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi) announced Monday.Under the agreements, Chinese vaccine makers Sinopharm and Sinovac will begin to make 110 million doses immediately available, according to a news release from Gavi, a public-private global health partnership that is co-leading COVAX, a worldwide initiative aimed at distributing vaccines to countries regardless of wealth. , The agreements came at a time when \"the Delta variant is posing a rising risk to health systems,\" Gavi said in the statement. , Gavi has the option to purchase a total of 170 Sinopharm vaccines and 380 million Sinovac vaccines, Gavi said., China has already sent millions of vaccine doses around the world as part of President Xi Jinping\'s vision to make the country\'s vaccines a \"global public good.\", As of June 30, Sinovac had delivered more than 1 billion doses worldwide, the company\'s chairman and chief executive Weidong Yin said in a statement about the COVAX deal., \"Our mission at Sinovac is to supply vaccines in an effort to eliminate human disease,\" he said. , The new agreements were welcomed by Dr. Seth Berkley, the chief executive of Gavi, who said the vaccines were an example of Gavi\'s strategy to ensure there were \"options in the face of constraints such as supply delays.\", COVAX\'s rollout fell behind schedule earlier this year, after a coronavirus crisis in India meant the country\'s biggest vaccine manufacturer failed to deliver millions of shots on time. , Monday\'s announcement comes as Chinese vaccines face growing scrutiny over their efficacy, particularly against the swift-spreading Delta variant., Thai health authorities announced Monday that health care workers would receive a booster shot of either AstraZeneca or Pfizer, after 618 of more than 677,000 medical personnel who received two doses of Sinovac tested positive for Covid-19. Of the 618 who tested positive, only two became seriously ill, including one nurse who died., , \"Despite that, all vaccines have been proven to be efficient in preventing hospitalization and death,\" Ministry of Foreign Affairs official Pensom Lertsithichai said at a briefing Monday, adding that medical workers had high exposure to Covid-19 which could have contributed to \"vaccination failure.\", Officials in Singapore said last week they would exclude Sinovac shots from the city-state\'s total vaccination count due to inadequate efficacy data for the vaccine, especially against the Delta variant, Reuters reported. , Both Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines have been validated by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. , So far, trials show Sinopharm and Sinovac have a lower efficacy against Covid-19 than their mRNA counterparts. In Brazilian trials, Sinovac had about 50% efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19, and 100% effectiveness against severe disease, according to trial data submitted to WHO. Sinopharm\'s efficacy for both symptomatic and hospitalized disease was estimated at 79%, according to WHO., Vaccines from both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna -- which have also signed deals with COVAX -- are more than 90% effective against symptomatic Covid-19. , COVAX has legally-binding contracts with manufacturers for about 3.8 billion doses -- and 1.9 billion of those are forecast to be available for supply by the end of the year, according to COVAX\'s most recent global supply forecast.

You\'ve got make a decision -- does the benefit outweigh the unusual risk of an adverse event? Thus far with the vaccines, it\'s always been decided that the benefit of the vaccine outweighs the risk of an adverse event.\" , The CDC and FDA are monitoring cases of the syndrome., \"GBS is a neurological disorder in which the body\'s immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness or, in the most severe cases, paralysis.

It was out of my control, really.\", , Experts say these feelings are common -- as is the stigma around discussing them. , \"Infertility strikes deep into a man\'s soul and it\'s something they never thought about or ever thought would be a problem,\" said Dr. Paul Turek, a reproductive urologist and one of the leading US experts on male infertility., \"The most profound example is a man who is sterile with no sperm in his semen,\" Turek said. \"I did a blog on this (topic) and I asked my patients, \'What was the first thing that crossed your mind when you learned you were sterile?\' And my favorite response was, \'I had a biological identity crisis.\' It hits them like nothing else could.\", Up to one-third of would-be parents\' infertility issues are caused by the male factor. Another one-third are due to female factor infertility and the remaining one-third are unexplained, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine., Though men and women carry an equal burden, the focus is still so much more on women when it comes to fertility treatments., \"People always forget about the male ingredient when you\'re trying to bake this pregnancy,\" Dr. Brian Levine, founding partner and practice director of fertility clinic CCRM New York, told CNN. , \"It\'s unfortunate because I think that men are ashamed or uncomfortable in talking about either their sexual performance or their sexuality in general, even though we have hyper-sexualized commercial aspects in this country where quote unquote, sex sells,\" Levine said. , \"Women feel like there are more resources out there for them to learn about the treatments and the path to parenthood,\" he said. \"And because we assign this machismo or societal pressure to fatherhood and parenting a child, that it\'s really hard for a guy to deal with the diagnosis of infertility.\", What is male factor infertility?, The definition of male factor infertility is \"the inability to conceive a child after 1 year of regular, unprotected intercourse,\" according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., The Mayo Clinic states that the normal sperm range is from 15 million to greater than 200 million sperm per milliliter of semen. A person is considered to have a low sperm count if he has fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter., Sperm issues, the CDC says, can be caused by age, if the male partner is over 40, being overweight, excessive alcohol use, exposure to radiation, certain medications, environmental toxins and frequent exposure to high temperatures. , The cause could also be a varicocele, an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum, which can sometimes be corrected with a relatively simple surgery called a varicocelectomy., But this list isn\'t exhaustive. It\'s something my husband and I found ourselves struggling to understand because Brian, a longtime athlete who has been on the cover of Men\'s Health Magazine twice, considered himself to be the epitome of health. He doesn\'t drink alcohol, do drugs or have known exposure to any of the CDC-indicated risk factors for low sperm count. , Our own fertility doctor, Dr. David Reichman, associate professor of reproductive medicine at the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College said that sometimes male infertility doesn\'t have a clear explanation., \"It\'s frustrating because you want to feel like you have some control over it, modifiable factors,\" Dr Reichman told CNN. \"That if I only do a better job then things will improve but unfortunately there are a lot of cases where it\'s not so cut and dry.\", So you\'re infertile, now what?, When it comes to infertility, one might think of the cost associated with treatments., \"Fixing the male problem is always more cost-effective than going to ART [Assisted Reproductive Technology],\" Turek said., He\'s right. One round of IVF in the United States can cost upward of $12,000 -- not including medication, according to the University of Iowa Stead Family Children\'s Hospital., \"The first move in my practice is lifestyle change. Sometimes if you\'re working out too much that can be the problem. Sleep, rest, stress reduction, perhaps more exercise, acupuncture and yoga -- that has more impact than you think,\" Dr. Turek said., \"Then you go to medical therapy, which is based generally on hormones. Clomid is one of those ... other medical therapy can be a pre-natal supplement for men. If medical therapy fails, then you go to surgical therapy. If nothing else is available, I say go to ART.\", More women are speaking out when it comes to infertility, and thanks to people like former first lady Michelle Obama, Chrissy Teigen and Khloé Kardashian, the conversation is becoming normalized. We are finding our tribe and embracing one another through numerous social media groups, podcasts and even rallies. , But I can\'t think of one well-known guy at this point who has come out and talked about his sperm issues.  , \"For the longest time it\'s been more rare to see a male emote, and it\'s been more culturally and societally acceptable to have women expressing their feelings,\" Dr. Reichman said. \"Ten years ago, I don\'t think women were talking about their fertility like they are now. I think it\'s more of a hurdle for men because it does go against that stereotype macho perception of men that we need to undo. , \"We need prominent individuals to normalize the experience of men,\" he added. \"Fertility has always been a taboo subject historically, and I think for men the ability to reproduce is so tied up in their quote-unquote manhood and so it\'s a real threat to the male ego and it shouldn\'t be.\" , My husband is speaking out, Barbara Collura, president and CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, said that infertility is still viewed by many as a \"woman\'s condition.\", \"We still have a long way to go, both in terms of men feeling open and accepted to share this information, men seeking out emotional support services, and society in general recognizing that infertility affects men,\" she said. , \"Most people are surprised to hear the prevalence of male factor infertility.\", A company called Legacy is looking to change that by partnering with well-known celebrities to talk about the importance of sperm testing and freezing., Founded by Khaled Kteily, Legacy sells the first at-home semen analysis kit that allows men to learn about their sperm by dropping it in the mail and even freezing it for the future without having to walk into a clinic. Celebrities like Justin Bieber, DJ Khaled, The Weeknd and Orlando Bloom are all investors in the company. , \"You need to go back to the science, because men and women will listen to the science. We know that sperm counts have declined 50 to 60% over the last 40 years and that there is a crisis when it comes to male factor infertility,\" Kteily told CNN. \"And also we need to raise awareness among men to talk about the challenges that they have faced with fertility.\", My husband is also using his platform to let men know that they are not alone. That\'s why he started a fundraiser called Run For a Chance, where he ran 50 miles across Westchester County in New York to bring attention to male factor infertility in December. , He\'s raised over $80,000 to cover treatment for three people at the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine of Weill Cornell Medicine, where we went through IVF to have our two children., \"I think vulnerability shows a certain level of masculinity, and I think more of us need to tap into that,\" he said. \"We all go through things in our lives, but male infertility does not make you any less of a man.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/13/health/male-factor-infertility-wellness/index.html',1,132),(100,'Some states move to block Covid-19 vaccine requirements in public schools','As the return to school approaches, some states are prohibiting public schools from requiring Covid-19 vaccinations or proof of vaccination for students ranging from pre-K to university.A CNN analysis has found that at least seven states -- Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Montana, Oklahoma and Utah -- have enacted legislation this year that would restrict public schools from requiring either coronavirus vaccinations or documentation of vaccination status., As of June 22, at least 34 states had introduced bills that would limit requiring someone to demonstrate their vaccination status or immunity against Covid-19, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which has been tracking legislation related to coronavirus vaccines. At least 13 states -- Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Utah -- have passed them into law, according to the document, and at least six of those include language pertaining specifically to schools or education. , Such moves leave public health officials worried about the limitations they could place on efforts to control the coronavirus and emerging variants -- especially if a health department has vaccination recommendations for schools., \"Anytime there\'s legislation that potentially prohibits the health department from trying to prevent the spread of disease, even if it\'s putting limits on masks or mandates on vaccination, then it\'s another step that local health departments would have to go through should there be an outbreak or a rise in cases,\" Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN., \"It will be concerning that this legislation is becoming more permanent,\" Freeman added., What each state\'s law says, The laws take different approaches, but the result is that schools can\'t require coronavirus vaccines, or in some cases, proof of vaccination. For some states, that\'s the case even as schools still expect students to arrive with other recommended childhood vaccinations, including those against measles, whooping cough, polio and chickenpox., , \"It seems to be kind of a mixed bag of all the things going on here -- there\'s the limiting of requiring proof of vaccine, there\'s the limiting of requiring the vaccination itself, the prohibition of the mandates. So, there\'s a lot,\" Freeman said. \"They\'re not all uniform.\", In Alabama, Gov. Kay Ivey signed into law Senate Bill 267, which states that \"institutions of education may continue to require a student to prove vaccination status as a condition of attendance only for the specific vaccines that were already required by the institution as of January 1, 2021\" -- which would not include coronavirus vaccines. , In Arkansas, Act 977 notes that receiving a coronavirus vaccine \"shall not be a condition of education\" and Florida\'s new law, prohibits educational institutions from requiring students or residents provide documentation certifying vaccination against Covid-19, sometimes described as a \"vaccine passport.\", Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who signed the law in May, argues that allowing \"vaccine passports\" requirements would create \"two classes of citizens\" based on vaccination status, his office told CNN in an email last week -- and that applies in schools, too., \"Florida\'s vaccine passport ban applies to schools, colleges, and universities,\" Christina Pushaw, a spokesperson for the governor\'s office, wrote in the email. \"Floridians have the right to medical privacy, which is why Gov. DeSantis banned invasive \'vaccine passports.\' No COVID-19 vaccine is required by law.\", In Indiana, House Enrolled Act 1405 was signed by Gov. Eric J. Holcomb in late April; it notes that \"the state or a local unit may not issue or require an immunization passport,\" meaning a documentation of someone\'s vaccination status -- and therefore, a vaccine requirement would be based on an honor system., Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita told CNN last week the law applies to public universities as an arm of the state, but there haven\'t been discussions yet about whether the law applies to local public school districts in Indiana. What\'s clear, he said, is that the law \"OKs a requirement. What it prohibits is proof -- so what was specifically prohibited was the vaccine passport.\", In Montana, the law signed by Gov. Greg Gianforte in May calls it \"an unlawful discriminatory practice\" to \"refuse, withhold from, or deny\" educational opportunities based on a person\'s vaccination status. , In Oklahoma, Senate Bill 658, signed into law in June, prohibits a public school district\'s board of education from requiring vaccination against Covid-19 as a condition of admittance to or attendance., And in Utah, House Bill 308, signed by Gov. Spencer J. Cox in March, \"prohibits a governmental entity from requiring that an individual receive a vaccine for COVID-19\"; the state legislature includes public school districts as political subdivisions of the state and public colleges and universities as governmental entities., \'Why would we want to take any legal public health tools off the table?\', Even though the laws aren\'t uniform, there\'s concern among some public health officials that prohibiting certain vaccine requirements could impact public opinions around both coronavirus vaccines and long-standing school vaccine requirements, said Brent Ewig, a policy consultant for the Association of Immunization Managers., It\'s not clear whether Covid-19 vaccine mandates would help vaccine uptake or create backlash, Ewig said. , \"I do think there are a couple of questions that can help guide this debate in the future -- and the first is that with more than 600,000 Americans dead, why would we want to take any legal public health tools off the table until we know what it will take to stop this?\", There is also concern about public safety and what such legislation could mean for the whole of public health. , For instance, some health officials worry that a coronavirus variant could emerge that might be more transmissible or dangerous, or that might directly impact children. Prohibiting vaccine mandates in schools could make it more difficult to implement measures that would help control the virus and prevent another pandemic. , Meanwhile, \"we do see a couple of states that, even at the same time they are trying to prohibit some of these mandates, they are adding provisional language to not apply to school immunization requirements,\" Freeman said. \"They\'re trying to walk the line there a little bit.\", One example is Louisiana, where in July, Gov. John Bel Edwards vetoed a bill that prohibited some requirements for vaccination because, according to his office, it would \"change Louisiana\'s approach to vaccine requirements for schools and educational facilities, which has been in place for decades without significant controversy.\" , In new Covid-19 schools guidance released on Friday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not address vaccine mandates, but notes that keeping track of students\' and workers\' Covid-19 vaccination status can help inform the prevention strategies used in a school, such as mask-wearing and physical distancing. , The CDC also says its guidance does not replace local guidance and policies., However, the CDC urges schools take steps to promote Covid-19 vaccination, including offering vaccines on site, providing paid sick leave for employees to get vaccinated and excusing absences for students to get vaccinated., Coronavirus vaccines are available only for people 12 and older, but vaccines for younger children are being studied., \"Vaccination is currently the leading public health prevention strategy to end the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the guidance says. \"Promoting vaccination can help schools safely return to in-person learning as well as extracurricular activities and sports.\", So far, most of the discussions around prohibiting vaccine mandates in schools have been in the context of college or university campuses., In April, the American College Health Association issued a policy statement recommending Covid-19 vaccination requirements for all on-campus college and university students for the upcoming fall semester, where state law and resources allow., Ewig said the focus has been more intense on the university level because vaccines were available earlier for people 18 and older earlier, and because of the risk of Covid-19 transmission in university living situations., \"I think the other issue is because it is still under emergency use authorization has created some hesitancy about going too far on this debate about mandating,\" he said. \"My sense is that there are a lot of people that are waiting on the timing of that from when it goes from FDA emergency use authorization to full licensure, which I think we expect sometime in the fall.\", Could FDA approval shift the mandate debate?, There are three coronavirus vaccines that the US Food and Drug Administration has authorized for emergency use in the United States: the Pfizer/BioNTech for ages 12 and older, and Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson for ages 18 and older. , Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have begun their applications to receive full FDA approval, and Johnson &amp; Johnson has said it intends to file for licensure., Once the coronavirus vaccines have received full approval under the FDA, that could change things, said Freeman of the National Association of County and City Health Officials., \"Authorization, that is not the same thing as a full approval,\" Freeman said. \"And so that would have to change first before any permanent recommendations were made about the child immunization requirements.\", But while full FDA approval could have an effect at the federal level or in private situations, it would not make a difference under the state law in Indiana, Attorney General Rokita told CNN. , \"I don\'t think this issue is going away,\" Rokita said. \"I don\'t think it\'s a matter too much of emergency use or not, because at the end of the day, this should be about people\'s right to make health care decisions that best suit their families, their personal medical circumstances, and even their religious beliefs.\", Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, thinks some of the hesitancy around issuing Covid-19 vaccine requirements is because the vaccines are still under emergency use authorization, he told CNN\'s Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" on Sunday. , \"But people need to understand that the amount of data right now that shows a high degree of effectiveness and a high degree of safety is more than we\'ve ever seen with emergency use authorization. So these vaccines are as good as officially approved, with all the I\'s dotted and the Ts crossed. It hasn\'t been done yet because the FDA has to do certain things, but it\'s as good as done,\" Fauci said., Asked by Tapper if it\'s \"generally a good idea for business or schools to require vaccination,\" Fauci replied there should be more mandates. , \"There really should be. We\'re talking about life and death situation,\" Fauci said. \"We\'ve lost 600,000 Americans already, and we\'re still losing more people. There\'ve been 4 million deaths worldwide.

That led to unusual pushback from the US Food and Drug Administration and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which said fully vaccinated Americans don\'t need boosters right now. ,  , \"Nothing has really changed,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN\'s Chris Cuomo after the meeting., The virtual meeting Monday evening lasted for an hour as Pfizer presented data.

We might need, as a matter of fact, at some time to give boosters either across the board or to certain select groups, such as the elderly or those with underlying conditions.\", Pfizer called the meeting \"productive.\" , , \"We had a productive meeting with U.S. public health officials on the elements of our research program and the preliminary booster data in our ongoing trials. Both Pfizer and the U.S. government share a sense of urgency in staying ahead of the virus that causes COVID-19, and we also agree that the scientific data will dictate next steps in the rigorous regulatory process that we always follow,\" the company said in a statement., Pfizer said it would be publishing \"more definitive data in a peer-reviewed journal and continuing to work with regulatory authorities to ensure that our vaccine continues to offer the highest degree of protection possible,\" according to Monday\'s statement., Separately, a HHS spokesperson told CNN the meeting was not unusual., \"Health officials are routinely briefed by manufacturers and others on the latest data on COVID-19 vaccines, and today Pfizer offered to brief officials on their latest preliminary data. We appreciate the information they shared, and officials continue to engage in a science-based rigorous process to consider whether, when, or for whom a booster might be necessary,\" the spokesperson said.,  , \"As CDC and FDA said last week, this process takes into account laboratory data, clinical trial data, and cohort data -- which can include data from specific pharmaceutical companies, but does not rely on those data exclusively,\" the HHS spokesperson added., \"At this time, fully vaccinated Americans do not need a booster shot. The vaccines available now offer a very high degree of protection. The administration is prepared for booster doses if and when the science demonstrates that they are needed, and any recommendation by CDC and FDA would come after their thorough review process.\", , The official added, \"Officials will continue to review any new data as it becomes available and will keep the public informed.\", Last week, Pfizer set off an unusually public confrontation with the FDA and CDC when it said data showed the efficacy of its vaccine was waning and boosters would be needed within six months to a year -- without providing that data to back up the statement. , Pfizer said it would seek emergency use authorization for a booster from the FDA in August. Hours after that announcement, FDA and CDC issued a joint statement saying that fully vaccinated Americans do not yet need a Covid-19 vaccine booster.,  , \"The United States is fortunate to have highly effective vaccines that are widely available for those aged 12 and up. People who are fully vaccinated are protected from severe disease and death, including from the variants currently circulating in the country such as Delta,\" they said., On Sunday, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner and current board member at Pfizer, told CBS that it was updated efficacy numbers from the Israeli Ministry of Health that led Pfizer to seek emergency use authorization for a booster dose of its Covid-19 vaccine. , , Israel\'s health ministry said in a statement last week that it had seen efficacy of Pfizer\'s vaccine drop from more than 90% to about 64% as the B.1.617.2 or Delta variant spread.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/health/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-meeting/index.html',1,134),(102,'Tennessee\'s vaccine manager says she\'s worried for her state after she was fired','The top vaccine official for the state of Tennessee said Monday she was fired after an argument over vaccinating children against coronavirus.Now Dr. Michelle Fiscus, a pediatrician who has served as the state\'s medical director of the vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization for two years, said she is afraid for the people of her state -- which is already lagging in vaccination against the virus., \"It is just astounding to me how absolutely political and self-centered our elected people are here and how very little they care for the people of Tennessee,\" Fiscus told CNN in a telephone interview., \"The people of Tennessee are going to pay a price.\", , Fiscus said she and other health officials have been under pressure, but the final straw was what should have been an innocuous memo citing Tennessee state law about whether minors may get medical care without their parents\' permission. , In 41 states, minors must have the consent of a parent or guardian to be immunized but Tennessee is one of five states that has a \"mature minor doctrine\" that allows health care providers to decide if any child has the capacity to consent to vaccination themselves., Four other states and Washington, DC set an age cutoff for a minor to decide without a parent or guardian., , Fiscus said all she did was share the memo that laid out a decades-old state policy., \"A recipient of that memo was upset that, according to Tennessee Supreme Court case law, minors ages 14-17 years are able to receive medical care in Tennessee without parental consent and posted the memo to social media,\" Fiscus said in a statement., \"Within days, legislators were contacting TDH (Tennessee Department of Health) asking questions about the memo with some interpreting it as an attempt to undermine parental authority.

It\'s about 40% to 60% more transmissible than the highly contagious Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control., In the United States, the Delta variant has spread to every state and is now responsible for more than 50% of Covid-19 cases, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. , \"In some parts of the country, this percentage is even higher, especially in areas with low vaccination rates,\" the CDC said. \"This rapid rise is concerning and threatens the progress the United States has made toward ending the pandemic.\", As the Delta variant keeps spreading, \"we know that there is a risk of breakthrough infection\" among fully vaccinated people, Wen said. \"So even if you are vaccinated, you could still get infected. The safest thing is for everyone around you -- even if you are vaccinated -- to also be vaccinated as well.\", But even when people do get breakthrough infections, the vaccines are still \"very, very high in effectiveness\" when it comes to preventing severe illness or hospitalization -- well into the 90% range, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases., There are some doctors who have expressed interest in giving a booster dose of vaccine to some patients, such as those who might be immunocompromised, Fauci said Sunday. , But the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration say those who are fully vaccinated don\'t need a booster shot right now., \"There will always be people, well-meaning people and well-meaning companies will say, \'You know, the way we look at the situation, it looks like you might need a booster, so let\'s go ahead and give a booster.\' But that\'s not a formal recommendation,\" Fauci said., \"Data evolves.

We are prepared for booster doses if and when the science demonstrates that they are needed.\", Some Americans were confused when Pfizer said immunity has partially waned for some of its vaccine recipients as the Delta variant spreads around the world. Pfizer said it\'s working to develop a booster dose to protect people from variants. , \"We see declining efficacy of the vaccine in Israel against the Delta variant, but that declining efficacy seems to be clustered among people who are older and who were vaccinated a while ago,\" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA commissioner and current board member at Pfizer, told CBS\' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday., \"With respect to the boosters, what we\'re talking about is a third dose of the existing vaccine,\" Gottlieb said. , \"Anyone who gets vaccinated right now will not need a booster. If you go out and get vaccinated right now, that vaccine is going to carry you through the fall and the winter. What we\'re really talking about right now is people who were vaccinated a while ago, where there may be some declining efficacy.\", Thursday, Pfizer said it would soon publish data about a third dose of vaccine and submit it to the FDA, the European Medicines Agency and other regulators. Pfizer said it would seek FDA emergency use authorization for a booster dose in August., Dr. Jerome Adams, the US surgeon general during the Trump administration, said he agrees with the CDC and the FDA that fully vaccinated people don\'t need a booster shot right now., \"Vaccinations are your best bet right now,\" Adams said Friday. \"They\'re still incredibly effective.

But those who aren\'t fully vaccinated, including children younger than 12 who are not yet eligible, should wear masks while indoors, the CDC said., The CDC suggests schools offer Covid-19 vaccines on site, provide paid sick leave for employees to get vaccinated and excuse absences for students 12 and older to get vaccinated. , If Covid-19 cases are low in a community, and local schools want to transition away from pandemic precautions, they should do so gradually, the CDC said in a draft of the guidance obtained by CNN., \"If localities decide to remove prevention strategies in schools based on local conditions, they should remove them one at a time and monitor closely (with adequate testing) for any increases in COVID-19 cases before removing the next prevention strategy,\" the guidance says. , Getting more people vaccinated will assist in that effort, many experts say.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/11/health/us-coronavirus-sunday/index.html',1,136),(104,'States with low vaccination numbers had Covid-19 case rates last week 3 times higher than others where people are fully vaccinated','When you compare states with high Over the past week, states that have fully vaccinated more than half of their residents have reported an average Covid-19 case rate that is about a third of that in states which have fully vaccinated less than half of their residents, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. , Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas are the only states to have fully vaccinated fewer than 35% of their residents. Average daily case rates in each state were among the 10 worst in the country last week., Vermont leads the nation with about 66% of its population fully vaccinated -- and while case rates there increased compared to last week,  the state still had the lowest case rate in the country last week, with an average of less than one new case per 100,000 people each day. , States that have fully vaccinated more than half of their residents reported an average of 2.8 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people each day last week, compared to an average of about 7.8 cases per 100,000 people each day in states that have vaccinated less than half of their residents., \"We really need to get more people vaccinated, because that\'s the solution,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday on \"CBS This Morning.\" \"This virus will, in fact, be protected against by the vaccine.\", Across the country, more than 99% of US Covid-19 deaths in June were among unvaccinated people, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., Dr. Howard Jarvis, an emergency medicine physician in Springfield, Missouri, told CNN on Monday that his sick patients are all unvaccinated., \"If they\'re sick enough to be admitted to the hospital, they are unvaccinated. That is the absolute common denominator amongst those patients,\" he said. \"I can see the regret on their face. You know, we ask them, because we want to know, are you vaccinated? And it\'s very clear that a lot of them regret (not being vaccinated).\", The pace of vaccinations has dropped sharply in recent months. About 246,000 people initiated vaccination each day over the past week, down 88% from the April peak, and about 278,000 people became fully vaccinated each day over the past week, down 84% from the April peak, CDC data shows., About 56.2% of Americans 12 or older are fully vaccinated., CDC, FDA looking into risk of nerve complication after J&amp;J shot, Federal health officials are investigating the possibility that Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s coronavirus vaccine might slightly raise the risk of a rare neurological complication known as Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a spokesperson from the CDC said in a statement to CNN on Monday., But even if the vaccine does raise the risk, it\'s still better to get vaccinated, the CDC stressed., \"GBS is a neurological disorder in which the body\'s immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness or in the most severe cases paralysis. Each year in the United States, an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people develop GBS; it is typically triggered by a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection. Most people fully recover from GBS,\" the spokesperson said., \"Reports of GBS after receipt of the J&amp;J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) are rare, but do likely indicate a small possible risk of this side effect following this vaccine. Around 100 preliminary reports of GBS have been detected in VAERS after 12.8 million doses of J&amp;J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine administered. These cases have largely been reported about two weeks after vaccination and mostly in males, many aged 50 years and older.\", The same pattern is not seen with the other two vaccines authorized in the United States, made by Moderna and Pfizer. The spokesperson said the CDC\'s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices would discuss the matter in an upcoming meeting., The US Food and Drug Administration updated the label for the vaccine Monday., \"Reports of adverse events following use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine under emergency use authorization suggest an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome during the 42 days following vaccination,\" the updated label reads., \'Surprising amount of death\' will occur in some US regions from increased cases, expert says, As the Delta variant rapidly spreads, US hot spots have seen climbing case numbers -- and an expert warns a \"surprising amount of death\" from Covid-19 could soon follow., The United States is averaging about 19,455 new cases over the past seven days, a 47% increase from the week prior, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. And a third of those, CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner said, come from five hot spots: Florida, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri and Nevada., \"In places like Missouri where ICUs are packed, you\'re going to see a surprising amount of death,\" Reiner said Sunday., At Mercy Hospital in Springfield, Missouri, 91% of patients in the intensive care unit are on ventilators and many are in their 20s, 30s and 40s, Chief Administrative Officer Erik Frederick told CNN on Saturday. That is especially concerning, he said, because at the peak last year there were only 40 to 50% of ICU patients on ventilators., Typically, spikes in Covid-19 cases leads to a rise in death rates three to four weeks later as a small percentage of the infected are hospitalized and deteriorate. \"We will start to see an increase in mortality in this country,\" Reiner said. , What is particularly frustrating for many experts, Reiner said, is that the deaths are \"completely avoidable\" now that vaccines are available. , \"The vaccines we have work really well against this variant. It doesn\'t need to be this way,\" Reiner said., Pfizer to brief the US on boosters, Another concern for many experts as variants spread is whether the population will need boosters for their vaccines. , Pfizer will virtually brief US government officials Monday evening regarding the potential need for booster shots of its Covid-19 vaccine, a company spokesperson and two administration officials confirmed to CNN. , The meeting is seen as a courtesy, and federal guidance on boosters is not expected to change immediately following the meeting, a senior health official said., Last week, Pfizer/BioNTech reiterated its expectation that people may need boosters to its vaccine in six months to a year, citing waning immunity they are seeing among people who got it. The company also said it would seek emergency use authorization in August from the US Food and Drug Administration for a booster., But some experts have argued the data is showing boosters are not necessary yet. , \"Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time,\" the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FDA said. \"FDA, CDC, and NIH (the National Institutes of Health) are engaged in a science-based, rigorous process to consider whether or when a booster might be necessary.\", Fauci also disputed the need at this time., \"Given the data and the information we have, we do not need to give people a third shot, a boost, superimposed upon the two doses you get with the mRNA (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccine) and the one dose you get with (Johnson &amp; Johnson),\" he told CNN on Sunday., Further, World Health Organization leaders asked wealthy countries Monday to hold off on giving booster doses to their residents before people in other countries can even get their first doses., \"Instead of Moderna and Pfizer prioritizing the supply of vaccines as boosters to countries whose populations have relatively high coverage, we need them to go all-out to channel supply to COVAX, the Africa Vaccine Acquisition task team, and low- and middle-income countries, which have very low vaccine coverage,\" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a media briefing., Experts weigh whether vaccinations should be mandated, In the United States, the now-dominant Delta variant, which is believed to be more transmissible, has driven the rising case numbers. And the variant has sparked discussions over local vaccination mandates., Experts say vaccines are key to managing spread. With information changing rapidly, it is important to be smart about how vaccinations are mandated, George Washington University School of Medicine professor Dr. Gigi El-Bayoumi said., \"In states where there are high vaccination rates, that are like 75 or above, it makes sense to loosen up the restrictions. In places where there are not, such as some of the Southern states, it makes sense\" to mandate vaccinations, El-Bayoumi said Sunday. , Mandates at the local level are a good idea, Fauci told CNN., \"We\'re talking about life and death situation. We\'ve lost 600,000 Americans already, and we\'re still losing more people. There\'ve been 4 million deaths worldwide,\" Fauci said. \"This is serious business.\", Fauci expects vaccine mandate hesitancy to lift when vaccines are fully approved, he said., Right now, Covid-19 vaccines are being administered under emergency use authorizations, which Fauci said has made some people skeptical as to their safety and efficacy. But the amount of data that supports the importance and safety of the vaccines is more than anything experts have seen for an EUA, he said. , \"These vaccines are as good as officially approved with all the I\'s dotted and T\'s crossed,\" Fauci said.

That boost in total sleep time included an additional 24 minutes of rapid eye movement (REM), the dream stage of sleep when memories are consolidated and stored. , \"The improvement in the rapid eye movement stage of sleep is really remarkable,\" said senior study author Ruth O\'Hara, a professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University. , \"Rapid eye movement is a very important phase of sleep for neuronal development and for the development of cognitive and emotional function,\" O\'Hara said. \"So it was a striking finding for us, and we were somewhat surprised at the substantial amount of benefits we saw in the quality of the children\'s sleep.\", The study, published Tuesday in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, found improvement in sleep began within three months of starting the training, and it increased with higher participation., , \"Children who reported using the techniques more often outside of class, at home, had larger gains in sleep over the time period we studied,\" O\'Hara said., In stark contrast, children who did not receive mindfulness training lost nearly 64 minutes of sleep over the same two-year period., \"It makes intuitive sense that children who didn\'t participate in the curriculum decreased their sleep, based on what we know about what it\'s like to be a kid this age,\" said lead author Christina Chick, a postdoctoral scholar in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford., \"Older children are possibly staying up to do homework or talk or text with friends,\" Chick added. \"I interpret our findings to mean that the curriculum was protective, in that it taught skills that helped protect against those sleep losses.\" , Sleep is critical for youth, Elementary-age children and pre-teens are supposed to get nine to 12 hours of sleep each night, while teens should sleep eight to 10 hours, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. , \"Children and adolescents who do not get enough sleep have a higher risk for many health problems, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, poor mental health, and injuries,\" according to the CDC. \"They are also more likely to have attention and behavior problems, which can contribute to poor academic performance in school.\", However, a 2015 CDC study found a majority of middle school and high school students reported getting less than the recommended amount of sleep for their age., , , The American Academy of Pediatrics has called sleep deprivation among children an \"epidemic\" and recommended in 2014 that middle and high schools start no earlier than 8:30 a.m. to allow teens to get the sleep they need., The consequences of a steady diet of poor sleep include mood disorders -- such depression and the potential for self-harm -- cognitive and memory problems, and metabolism disruption and obesity, according to the AAP. , \'Starfish\' and \'ocean\' breath, The study recruited 1,000 third and fifth graders from two school districts in lower income communities in the San Francisco Bay area. Many of the children\'s families were at or below poverty level and received food stamps, and all of the children participated in school lunch programs., Sleep can be especially problematic for children living in poverty due to crowded, unstable housing, food insecurity and possible higher levels of crime, according to the study., \"To fall asleep you have to relax, but they have a hard time letting their experiences go,\" said the study\'s lead investigator Dr. Victor Carrion, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry who directs the Stanford Early Life Stress and Resilience Program., \"They don\'t feel safe and may have nightmares and fears at night,\" said Carrion in a statement that said he launched the study to help young people manage the effects of living in a stressful environment., As part of the study, one school district served as a control group -- it did not implement any mindfulness education in physical education (PE) classes., The other school district implemented during PE a mindfulness curriculum from Pure Edge, a non-profit organization which provides free programs to schools and non-profits to build skills in stress management., Twice a week children were taught breathing techniques, yoga-based movement, and ways to recognize and cope with stress in PE class; they did traditional PE exercises for the other three days., \"Bringing awareness into the present moment, paying attention to bodily sensations of stress and recognizing how it can affect their mood was one focus of the training,\" Chick said., \"Alongside the mindfulness practice was teaching kids what stress was and recognizing that in their environment,\" Chick added., Techniques for mindful breathing were taught in an age-appropriate way. For example, Chick said, children in grades three through five were taught \"starfish breath,\" in which they \"imagine their hand is a starfish and they trace each finger up with the inhale and out with the exhale.\", Children in grades six though 12 were taught \"ocean breath,\" in which \"they breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth, as though they were fogging a mirror,\" she said., \"Children were taught that, through this type of mindful breathing, they could \'hack\' their brain and nervous system by calming a part of the nervous system that is usually automatic,\" Chick explained. \"In this way, they were taught how to be active participants in their own wellness.\", First study to objectively measure sleep, Out of the 1,000 children in the study, 58 who received the curriculum and 57 who were in the control group were recruited for at-home measurements of their brain activity during sleep. , \"It was like a mobile sleep lab,\" Chick said. \"We went to their homes, set up our sleep monitors, and placed a cap of electrodes on each child\'s head to measure their sleep cycle. We also measured their breathing, heart rates and blood oxygen levels.\", It is the first study to use objective sleep measurements, instead of relying on a child\'s description of how well they slept, O\'Hara said., , , \"Our study was the first to use this external, extensive polysomnography system -- which is the gold standard for measuring sleep architecture -- combined with a curriculum that actually targets mindfulness in the school setting,\" she said., In addition to the overall 74-minute increase in sleep, children who gained the most sleep during the study also reported increases in stress. That\'s likely because the mindfulness curriculum helped them understand what stress was, Chick said., \"Students actually reported using the stress reduction techniques quite a bit, even bringing them to the home environment,\" Chick said. \"We have some quotes from the students like, \'If my mom is getting stressed, I tell her we should do a deep breathing exercise.\'\", Sign up for for CNN\'S Sleep, But Better newsletter. You\'ll get more guidance and support for sleeping better., , Researchers at Stanford plan to continue to analyze the data gathered from the study to see whether the extra sleep also impacted the children\'s academic scores, and they hope to encourage other school districts around the country to implement such mindfulness training., \"Given the that the curriculum is available at no cost to schools. I would highly encourage parents to advocate for the implementation of this or similar programs by their school districts,\" O\'Hara said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/06/health/child-sleep-mindfulness-wellness/index.html',1,139),(106,'Delta variant\'s trajectory in UK and Israel provides hope for US -- if we can keep vaccinating','All eyes are on the Delta variant that is now dominant in the United States as new Covid-19 cases rise week-to-week and the variant -- first identified in India and also known as B.1.617.2 -- accounts for a growing share. , But trends from Israel and the United Kingdom -- where the variant became dominant a few weeks sooner than in the US -- present hope for a less deadly and severe surge than others that have come before. And experts say that vaccination progress will be the most critical factor in preventing the worst outcomes.  ,  , In Israel, average daily cases are twice what they were in mid-April when the first cases of Delta were identified in the country. At that time, there were an average of five deaths each day in Israel. But despite the rise of the Delta variant -- which now accounts for more than 90% of new cases in the country -- average daily deaths have stayed consistently below that. In fact, Israel has had an average of less than two Covid-19 deaths per day since the last week of May, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. ,  , In the United Kingdom, both cases and deaths are higher than they were when the Delta variant became the dominant strain in the country in mid-May, but cases have climbed exponentially faster than deaths. Average daily deaths in the UK are about twice what they were when the Delta variant became dominant, and cases are about 12 times what they were. ,  , But trends in death due to Covid-19 lag a few weeks behind trends in cases, so the latest data on deaths should be closer in line with data on cases from a few weeks earlier. And even three weeks ago, average daily cases in the UK had multiplied more than the most recent daily deaths. , While both Israel and the UK foreshadow some optimism for Delta\'s trajectory in the United States, experts say that Israel\'s outcomes have been more overwhelmingly positive because of their substantial vaccination rate.  , , \"In my mind, vaccines are the single most important factor\" in the fight against the Delta variant, Becky Dutch, a virologist and chair of the University of Kentucky\'s department of molecular and cellular biochemistry, told CNN. ,  , , When the first cases of the Delta variant were identified in Israel, about 56% of the population was already fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data. But in the UK, only 2% of the population was fully vaccinated when the Delta variant was first identified there, only reaching 50% vaccination within the past week.   ,  , \"There is reason to be moderately hopeful -- with the caveat that the reason deaths and hospitalizations have not gone up as much is that there\'s pretty high immunity from vaccination and natural infection in individuals most at risk,\" Justin Lessler, a professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina, told CNN. , In a statement released Monday, the Israeli government said that its analysis has shown the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to provide 64% protection against infections caused by the Delta variant but 93% effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalizations, compared to research from May that reported it to be 97% effective. , \"If we picked a flu vaccine that is effective as the current mRNA vaccines appear to be against Delta, we would be celebrating. They\'re only slightly less good against Delta than the originally circulating strain,\" Lessler said. ,  , \"The concern is places in the US that have not seen a lot of Covid and vaccination rates among the high-risk population is low.\",  , Overall, vaccination rates in the US fall somewhere between Israel and the UK. About 16% of the population was fully vaccinated when the first cases of Delta were identified in the US and about 48% are fully vaccinated now that the variant has become dominant.  , And vaccination rates vary widely across the country. Less than a third of people in Alabama are fully vaccinated, compared to about two-thirds of people in Vermont, according to the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   ,  , \"The US is a patchwork now,\" Dutch said. \"It depends on where you live. If you live in a place with high vaccination rates and you\'re vaccinated yourself, I\'m not overly concerned about you. But if you\'re sitting in an area of the country with 35% of the population vaccinated and you\'re not vaccinated, I\'m much more concerned.\", , And while there is some evidence that the virus may evade natural immunity from previous infections and slightly lower the efficacy of the vaccines, experts say these findings are something to pay attention to, they\'re not something to panic about. ,  , Instead, Lessler says the rise and spread of the Delta and Alpha variants are a \"warning that the virus is going to continue to evolve and continue to -- in that evolution -- find ways around existing immunity,\" but that the hope is that vaccines will \"virtually eliminate severe disease\" for quite some time. , ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/09/health/delta-variant-trends-israel-uk/index.html',1,140),(107,'Tick season is here. Here\'s what you need to know','But while there may be a lower risk of Covid-19 transmission outside, there are other illnesses you can encounter in nature. Some of those come from tiny arachnids called ticks., Ticks don\'t fly, but they can latch onto your skin and in some cases, get you sick. Here\'s what you need to know to stay safe this summer., Tick-borne diseases, Lyme disease is one of the most common diseases carried by ticks. It\'s most frequently reported in the upper Midwestern and Northeastern United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., Symptoms show up three to 30 days after a tick bite. They can include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and muscle and joint aches. About 70% to 80% of infected patients get a rash, which expands over time and sometimes has a bull\'s-eye appearance. , Other tick-borne diseases include anaplasmosis, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, spotted fever rickettsiosis and tularemia. These are also mostly found in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the US., , , Preventing illness, Ticks are most active in the warmer months -- April through September -- according to the CDC. They live in grassy, shrub-laden or wooded areas, and can latch on to you if you brush past whatever they are resting on. So if you\'re on hiking trails, for example, walk in the center of them., Another precaution the CDC recommends is using Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol or 2-undecanone., , , After you come indoors, you\'ll want to check your clothes and skin for ticks. , Tumble-dry clothes on high heat for 10 minutes to kill ticks on garments that aren\'t being washed. If you do wash your clothing, use hot water., Do a full body check, especially under the arms, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, the back of the knees, in and around the hair, between the legs, and around the waist., , , If you find a tick on your skin or that of your children, remove it right away. Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to your skin as possible. Steadily pull straight up. Then disinfect your hands, the affected skin area and the tweezers., If you have a rash or fever within several weeks of removing a tick, the CDC recommends seeing your doctor., Don\'t forget your pets, Your pets can also get tick-borne diseases. The CDC says dogs are very susceptible to tick bites, which may be hard to detect., Signs of tick-borne disease may not show up for at least one to three weeks after a bite, so watch your dog closely for changes in behavior or appetite if you think that has happened, the agency says., , , Keep ticks away from pets in your backyard by applying pesticides outdoors, removing leaf litter and tall grasses, placing a 3-foot-wide barrier of wood chips or gravel between lawns and wooded areas, and stacking wood neatly and in a dry area., Keep playground equipment, decks and patios away from yard edges and trees, use fences to keep out unwelcome animals, such as deer or raccoons, and remove old furniture or trash from the yard that may give ticks a place to hide.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/health/ticks-prevention-wellness-trnd/index.html',1,141),(108,'What Pfizer\'s plan for a third coronavirus vaccine dose means for you','Even though the biopharmaceutical company Pfizer has announced that it might be time to consider giving a third dose of its coronavirus vaccine to people, many doctors and public health officials argue that it\'s more beneficial to get shots into the arms of the unvaccinated right now than to boost those who are already fully vaccinated., \"It\'s wonderful to have a booster approved for emergency use authorization on the shelf -- ready to go any time we need it. But I do not think we need it right now,\" Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Friday.  , On Thursday, the companies Pfizer and BioNTech announced that a third dose of their coronavirus vaccine, given six months after a second dose, appears to preserve \"the highest levels of protection\" in those who were vaccinated., The companies made their announcement without releasing any new data, but noted plans to publish new information soon. A Pfizer spokesperson later told CNN that the company plans to file for emergency use authorization for a booster dose with the US Food and Drug Administration in August., Just hours after the Pfizer/BioNTech announcement was made, the FDA and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pushed back in an unprecedented joint statement emphasizing that people who are fully vaccinated \"do not need a booster shot at this time\" and people who are unvaccinated should \"get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and their community.\", The statement also said, \"We are prepared for booster doses if and when the science demonstrates that they are needed.\", But that science is unclear, and there is still much to learn about the potential need for booster doses of coronavirus vaccine. , \"We respect what the pharmaceutical company is doing, but the American public should take their advice from the CDC and the FDA,\" National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN on Friday. \"The message is very clear: the CDC and the FDA say if you have been fully vaccinated at this point in time, you do not need a booster shot.\", Here is what we do and don\'t know., Known -- vaccines still work, even against variants, Vaccine makers are looking ahead at what might be needed in the future while public health officials are focused on the present need for vaccinations, Dr. Jerome Adams, former US surgeon general under the Trump administration, told CNN\'s John Berman on Friday morning., , \"The companies are thinking about where the hockey puck is going,\" Adams said during an appearance on New Day. \"Whereas the government, FDA and CDC, are looking at where the hockey puck is right now. They want to reassure Americans your best protection still is a vaccine, and you still have great protection -- better than for the flu shot in any given year -- even in the face of variants and waning immunity.\", Some real-world evidence of waning immunity with Pfizer\'s coronavirus vaccine has emerged in Israel, where the Ministry of Health issued a brief statement Monday saying an analysis had shown the coronavirus vaccine was somewhat less protective against severe disease than before, and linked this change to the spread of the Delta variant, a more transmissible and possibly more dangerous strain of coronavirus., , The Israeli government\'s statement said that as of June 6, the vaccine provided 64% protection against all infections, including asymptomatic infection and mild disease, and 93% efficacy in preventing severe disease and hospitalizations., When it comes to whether booster doses might be needed to help protect people against emerging coronavirus variants specifically, Schaffner said that the Pfizer vaccine and others already have been shown to still offer some protection. , \"It\'s really unusual for a vaccinated person to be admitted to the hospital today for Covid-related illness, reinforcing the notion that these vaccines are still working against the variants,\" Schaffner said. The Delta variant now makes up more than half of all new Covid-19 infections in the United States, according to estimates from the CDC., Overall, since protection from the vaccine against severe Covid-19 still remains high, Schaffner said that fully vaccinated people should not worry., , \"Protection against hospitalization and intensive care unit admission and dying continues -- and so, those antibodies that are produced by the vaccine are really still providing very solid protection for persons who have received the vaccine,\" Schaffner said, adding that he is fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine., \"We had hoped that the vaccines could protect not only against serious disease, but our getting infected. They do have some impact in diminishing our chance of getting infected,\" he added. \"It\'s not as good as we had hoped, but that\'s less important, because the main goal of the vaccine was to keep us out of the hospital, and vaccines continue to do that very well.\", , Unknown -- when we will need third doses of vaccine, Experts say more data is needed to decide on whether people might eventually need booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines. , , A rise in so-called breakthrough cases might offer a clue in the future, federal vaccine advisers said during a meeting in June. A \"breakthrough\" infection refers to Covid-19 cases that occur after someone has been fully vaccinated., Members of the CDC\'s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices discussed in a meeting last month when it might be time for the agency to make recommendations for booster doses of vaccine., Committee members mostly agreed that more data around the benefits of boosters is needed -- but a rise in \"breakthrough\" infections could be a sign in the future that immunity is waning and it\'s time to reevaluate the need for boosters., , , \"I think the only thing we can do at this moment is, if we start to see an uptick in reinfections in people, or new infections in people who have been vaccinated, that\'s our clue that we need to move quickly,\" ACIP member Dr. Sharon Frey, who is a vaccine specialist at St Louis University Medical School, said in last month\'s meeting., In general, \"what we are looking for is both a very careful look at breakthrough cases and also whether there is currently an uptick in the elderly -- that would be pretty clear because they are currently so well controlled,\" said ACIP member Dr. Sarah Long, a professor of pediatrics at Drexel University College of Medicine., \"It would be a mistake to be giving booster doses without both some information about number one: Do they boost? And a little bit of safety data,\" Long said. \"So that we would have some idea that there would be benefit of the booster before we might incur unknown risk.\", Known -- some people might benefit more from a boost than others, In the future, there are some people who might benefit from booster doses of coronavirus vaccine more than others, including those who are immunocompromised. Schaffner said patients who fall into the category represent between 2% and 4% of the US population., For instance, organ transplant recipients might not have an adequate response to coronavirus vaccines because they take drugs to suppress their immune systems. That helps reduce the risk of the body rejecting new organs but may also limit responses to vaccines. , A third dose of coronavirus vaccine could help boost antibody levels among some organ transplant recipients who have not had robust responses to the standard vaccination schedules, according to a study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine in June. , Among patients in the study who had no measurable antibodies after receiving two doses of vaccine, one-third of them saw a rise in antibodies after a third dose -- and among those with low antibody levels after two doses, all of them saw an increase after a third dose., But there\'s not much data on vaccinations in immunocompromised people because when pharmaceutical companies tested coronavirus vaccines in clinical trials last year, they specifically excluded people who were taking immunosuppressive drugs due to potential risks., , In last month\'s meeting, the CDC\'s ACIP panel discussed this and the high-risk groups of people -- immunocompromised patients, long-term care facility residents, older adults, and health care personnel -- who may benefit from booster doses more than the general public., \"I have personally seen people die well after two full doses of mRNA vaccine because, we believe, they were immunocompromised and didn\'t have full protection,\" said ACIP member Dr. Camille Kotton, who cares for immunocompromised patients at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School., \"So, for me, this is the next important frontier that we really need to deal with and as rapidly as possible,\" Kotton said about booster doses., Kotton encouraged her colleagues on the committee to consider proceeding with recommendations for booster shots \"as soon as we have good science\" available on which to base decisions., \"I would wait for the additional data to be available, including the safety data as well,\" Kotton said, adding, \"This is a hot topic.\", Known -- vaccine makers will seek full approval soon, There are three coronavirus vaccines authorized for emergency use in the United States: the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for ages 12 and older, and the two-dose Moderna vaccine and one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine for ages 18 and older. , The companies Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have begun their applications to receive full FDA approval to use their vaccines and Johnson &amp; Johnson has said it intends to file an application but has not yet done so.   , , To get more people vaccinated against Covid-19, it could be beneficial for the FDA to consider approving Pfizer\'s vaccine before authorizing a booster shot, Dr. Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean at Emory University School of Medicine, told CNN on Friday. He added that he received the Pfizer vaccine in December and is not \"running to find a booster\" right now. , \"The most important thing for the FDA to do right now is not to consider a Pfizer request for a booster shot. It\'s actually to get full FDA approval for the vaccine, because that will change the dynamic,\" del Rio said, adding that it will be easier to get more people vaccinated., , , Due to the seriousness of the pandemic, vaccine makers originally applied for EUAs because the authorization process takes less time than what would be required for full approval. Emergency use authorization is what its name suggests -- a medical product, such as a vaccine, that gets special FDA authorization to be used during an emergency., Progressing from authorized to approved would allow manufacturers to market and directly distribute their vaccines. It could also have an impact on vaccine mandates -- and perhaps sway skeptics hesitant to get the vaccines now., \"I\'m worried about the fact that the FDA quite frankly hasn\'t yet given us an update on full approval of these vaccines, which we know is causing hesitancy in many people and which also is causing companies and businesses and schools to delay their decisions about vaccine mandates,\" Adams said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/09/health/pfizer-third-coronavirus-vaccine-dose-explainer-wellness/index.html',1,142),(109,'Los Angeles County sees exponential growth in Covid-19 cases as Delta variant becomes dominant, worrying officials','The most populous county in the US is seeing \"exponential growth\" of Covid-19 cases as the Delta variant takes over as the\"We do continue to see an uptick in cases and hospitalizations,\" Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Thursday. \"Deaths, fortunately, continue to be relatively low, but as hospitalizations continue to increase, we anticipate that deaths might also increase.\", While 60% of those over 16 years old have been fully vaccinated, Los Angeles County\'s case rate jumped from 1.74 cases to 3.5 cases per 100,000 people in one week, according to a news release from the county Department of Public Health. The overwhelming majority of those testing positive in the county are unvaccinated, representing 99.96% of all new infections, the release said. , The jump mirrors upticks in other parts of the country over the past week, as experts warn of Delta\'s high transmissibility. , Those warnings come as some focus turns to the future and what the coming months will look like amid Delta\'s rise and continued vaccine hesitancy: Pfizer says it will soon seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for a booster shot after seeing waning immunity from its vaccine, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention releases updated school guidance, underscoring the importance of in-person learning this fall. , Overall, California\'s Covid-19 positivity rate -- the percentage of all tests that are positive -- has tripled since the state fully reopened last month. The rate now surpasses 2% for the first time since early March, after hitting a low of 0.7% in early June, according to new data from the state\'s Department of Public Health., The Delta variant, first detected in India, has been found in 43% of new sequenced samples in California, the state said., And it also makes up more than 50% of sequenced samples across the country. In some places, it\'s even more, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., \"Although we expected the Delta variant to become the dominant strain in the United States, this rapid rise is troubling,\" she said., In parts of the Midwest and upper Mountain states, it accounts for about 80% of cases, CDC data suggests. , \"Widespread vaccination is what will truly turn the corner on this pandemic,\" Walensky said. \"Please know, if you are not vaccinated, you remain susceptible.\" , Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, said the Delta variant could bring about mini-surges in infections in regions where the vaccination rate remains low. , \"I\'m concerned as this variant becomes more dominant, those select areas of the country that have a very low level of vaccination, like 30% or so, you\'re going to start seeing mini-surges that are localized to certain regions,\" he said Friday., \"You don\'t want to see two separate Americas, one that\'s vaccinated and protected and yet another that\'s unvaccinated and very much at risk,\" Fauci said. , Pfizer says it\'s developing a booster shot after seeing waning immunity , Pfizer announced Thursday it was seeing waning immunity from its vaccine -- manufactured in partnership with BioNTech -- and was picking up its efforts to develop a booster shot to offer further protection against variants., \"As seen in real world data released from the Israel Ministry of Health, vaccine efficacy in preventing both infection and symptomatic disease has declined six months post-vaccination, although efficacy in preventing serious illnesses remains high,\" Pfizer said in a statement emailed to CNN., Israel\'s health ministry had seen efficacy of Pfizer\'s vaccine drop from more than 90% to about 64% as the Delta variant spread, it said in a statement this week., A Pfizer spokesperson later told CNN the company planned to request FDA emergency use authorization for a booster shot in August., But hours after the Pfizer statement, the US Food and Drug Administration and the CDC issued a joint statement saying Americans don\'t need booster shots yet. Dr. William Schaffner, professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, supported the US government\'s stance.  , \"The answer is that our vaccines still are very, very effective in keeping us out of the hospital, in averting severe disease. That\'s what they were designed to do,\" he told CNN on Thursday. \"Now, it\'s a bonus if they can also prevent what we call infection. You can get infected, have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. They diminish that possibility greatly. But they can\'t turn it off completely.\" , Dr. Peter Hotez, chair of Tropical Pediatrics at Texas Children\'s Hospital, agreed. \"We don\'t need to be concerned\" about a third Covid-19 vaccine dose right now, Hotez said. , \"Protection against the Delta variant is pretty robust,\" Hotez told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper. \" Yes, we will need a third immunization, but not now and not for the Delta variant.\", Breakthrough infections with no symptoms prove vaccines work, Walensky says, People who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 should continue to feel very protected against serious disease, CDC Director Walensky told CNN on Friday., Cases where vaccinated people get infected but have no symptoms should be seen as \"vaccine success,\" not failure, Walensky said, because the vaccine is doing what it was developed to do: prevent severe disease and death. , Early studies have also confirmed that most people who develop breakthrough infections do not replicate enough virus in their bodies to become contagious, she said. Even though people might test positive, they are not likely a source of spread of the virus., , Former US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams told CNN on Friday he found the apparent \"lack of coordination on communication\" between vaccine companies and the federal government \"troubling.\" , But he explained the differing views like this: Vaccine companies are thinking about the future -- or as he said, \"where the hockey puck is going\" -- while the government is thinking about the present and trying to convince the vaccine-hesitant to get inoculated. , \"We know immunity does tend to wane over time as we go into winter,\" he said. \"We want to make sure we are in the best possible position to protect vulnerable people in nursing homes,\" who were first vaccinated and would be at most risk from waning immunity and the Delta variant. , Meantime, government agencies like the CDC and the FDA want \"to reassure Americans your best protection still is a vaccine and you still got great protection -- better than for the flu shot in any given year -- even in the face of variants and waning immunity.\" , \"Vaccinations are your best bet right now. They\'re still incredibly effective,\" Adams said. And if Americans ultimately need a booster shot, \"people shouldn\'t get too worked up about that,\" he said. \"We do that for the flu every single year.\", In a statement Friday, Pfizer said, \"We regularly discuss our entire research program with regulators and public health authorities in the US and other countries around the world.\", Fauci on Friday pushed back against the suggestion that Americans were receiving a mixed message that could potentially hurt vaccination rates in areas where they are already low., \"It appears to be a mixed message but is not. The message is very clear: the CDC and the FDA say if you have been fully vaccinated at this point in time, you do not need a booster shot,\" Fauci told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer., CDC schools guidance prioritizes in-person learning, In updated guidance for schools, the CDC on Friday emphasized in-person learning is a priority this fall, regardless of whether all Covid-19 prevention measures are implemented in schools. , But it\'s still important to layer safety strategies like masking, physical distancing and, most importantly, vaccinations for everyone who is eligible. , Physical distancing should be practiced in schools where not everyone is vaccinated, the CDC guidance says, but students should not be excluded from in-person learning to maintain that physical distancing. , In line with current guidelines, the CDC recommends unvaccinated people over the age of 2 wear masks indoors. People who are fully vaccinated generally don\'t need to wear masks., The updated guidance also suggests schools take steps to promote vaccination, like offering vaccines on site and providing paid sick leave for employees to get vaccinated, as well as excusing students who are getting vaccinated., Communities are urged to closely monitor local Covid-19 transmission, vaccination coverage, screening testing and outbreaks when deciding what prevention strategies they need., Schools that are ready to transition away from pandemic precautions as community transmission reaches low levels should do so gradually, removing them one at a time while continuing to watch local conditions.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/09/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html',1,143),(110,'With an uptick in Covid-19 cases, there is growing alarm. \'We\'ve seen almost an entire takeover in the Delta variant,\' one state official says','The US has surpassed 20,000 new The last time the country had back-to-back days of cases topping 20,000 was in May, according to the data., Dr. Rochelle Walensky, who heads the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Thursday that more than 9 million people live in counties where cases are rising and where the vaccination rates are lower than 40%.  , \"Many of these counties are also the same locations where the Delta variant represents the large majority of circulating virus,\" she said., Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the variant could bring about mini-surges in infections in those areas. , \"I\'m concerned as this variant becomes more dominant, those select areas of the country that have a very low level of vaccination, like 30% or so, you\'re going to start seeing mini-surges that are localized to certain regions,\" he said Friday., \"You don\'t want to see two separate Americas, one that\'s vaccinated and protected and yet another that\'s unvaccinated and very much at risk,\" Fauci said. , Overall, 47.9% of the US population is fully vaccinated while 20 states have fully vaccinated more than half of their residents., Sounding the alarm in Mississippi, The surge has alarmed officials in Mississippi, where only a third of the population is fully vaccinated. , \"We\'ve seen almost an entire takeover in the Delta variant,\" said State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs., \"We\'re seeing a lot of outbreaks. We\'re seeing a lot of outbreaks in youth. We\'re seeing a lot of outbreaks in summer activities. We\'re also seeing a lot of outbreaks in nursing homes, where we have our most vulnerable people,\" he said., Case numbers and hospitalizations are trending upward because of the spread of the virus mostly among those who are unvaccinated, State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers said., While the number of deaths hasn\'t risen, Byers said they anticipate that to change because death numbers tend to lag behind case numbers., The state is advising seniors aged 65 and older to avoid mass gatherings until July 26, regardless of vaccination status. , People who are immunocompromised -- whose immune system is weaker -- are also recommended to follow the new guidance issued Friday. , , Advice for those with upper respiratory symptoms, As cases rise, the CDC is urging all adults and children who exhibit upper respiratory symptoms to be tested for Covid-19, regardless of their vaccination status, Walensky told CNN on Friday. , While there is considerable overlap between symptoms of the common cold and Covid-19, as they are both respiratory diseases, not everyone will experience the same symptoms for either illness -- and some people might not experience any symptoms at all. , However, she said that people who are fully vaccinated should continue to feel very protected against serious illness. , A breakthrough infection should be thought of as \"vaccine success\" as opposed to vaccine failure, Walensky said, because the vaccine is doing what it was developed to do: prevent severe disease and death., Breakthrough infections occur when fully vaccinated people contract the virus., Early studies have also confirmed that most people who develop breakthrough infections do not replicate enough virus in their bodies to become contagious, she said. Even though people might test positive, they are not likely a source of the spread of the virus., Will a booster be needed in the future?, After Pfizer announced Thursday that it\'s working to develop a third vaccine booster shot, questions emerged about the long-term effectiveness of vaccines. , In response, Fauci said people should take booster advice from federal health officials. , \"Certainly, they need to listen to the CDC and the FDA, the FDA being the regulatory authority that has control over this. And the CDC, in accordance with their advisory committee on immunization practices, will make the recommendation,\" he said., \"We respect what the pharmaceutical company is doing, but the American public should take their advice from the CDC and the FDA,\" he said., Dr. Peter Hotez, chair of tropical pediatrics at Texas Children\'s Hospital, said the current vaccines offer high protection. , \"It looks like the two doses of the current vaccine are pretty robust against the Delta variant,\" Hotez said Friday. \"So yes, we\'ll need a booster, but nothing to worry about right now in terms of vaccination.\", Pfizer said it was seeing waning immunity from its vaccine -- manufactured in partnership with BioNTech -- and was picking up its efforts to develop a booster shot to offer further protection against variants., Dr. Stephen Thomas, coordinating principal investigator for Pfizer/BioNTech\'s vaccine trial, said it wasn\'t unusual for vaccine-induced immunity to wane over time. , \"What is the crucial point though, and which we don\'t know the answer to right now is, even though that immunity wanes over time, does it remain above a level which we need to protect people,\" he told CNN\'s Erin Burnett. , \"I would kind of focus people on the point here, that the public health burden of Covid is severe disease, hospitalization and death,\" he said. \"Even though these vaccine immune responses wane over time, they are very, very effective at preventing those three outcomes.\", Federal guidance on school in fall encourages in-person learning, Meanwhile, the CDC on Friday said schools should prioritize in-person schooling in the fall but it was crucial to layer safety strategies such as masking and physical distancing, and most importantly, vaccinations for everyone eligible., Schools that are ready to transition away from pandemic precautions as community transmission reaches low levels should do so gradually, the agency said in a draft of the guidance obtained by CNN., \"If localities decide to remove prevention strategies in schools based on local conditions, they should remove them one at a time and monitor closely (with adequate testing) for any increases in COVID-19 cases before removing the next prevention strategy,\" the guidance says, adding that schools need to be transparent with families, staff and the community as they do so. , Fauci agrees, adding that unvaccinated children should wear masks. , \"I think that the message from the CDC is clear and I totally agree with them,\" Fauci told CNN. \"We want all the children back in in-person classes in the fall term.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/10/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html',1,145),(111,'Delta variant is \'Covid-19 on steroids,\' expert says, with cases increasing in nearly half of US states','Twenty-four states have seen an uptick of at least 10% in The rapid spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus has only ratcheted up the pressure. , That variant, first identified in India, accounted for 51.7% of all new Covid-19 infections in the country over the two weeks that ended Saturday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated. , \"We should think about the Delta variant as the 2020 version of Covid-19 on steroids,\" Andy Slavitt, a former senior adviser to Joe Biden\'s Covid Response Team, told CNN on Wednesday. \"It\'s twice as infectious. Fortunately, unlike 2020, we actually have a tool that stops the Delta variant in its tracks: It\'s called vaccine.\", For fully vaccinated people, the variant \"presents very little threat to you, very unlikely that you\'re gonna get sick,\" he said , Full approval for vaccines from the US Food and Drug Administration could encourage more people to get vaccinated, Slavitt and other experts have said. The current vaccines distributed in the US are authorized for emergency use only. Full approval for the Pfizer vaccine could come as early as this month, Slavitt said Tuesday., On Thursday, Pfizer said it was seeing waning immunity from its vaccine. The company is now picking up its efforts to develop a booster dose that will protect people from variants. , \"Based on the totality of the data they have to date, Pfizer and BioNTech believe that a third dose may be beneficial within 6 to 12 months following the second dose to maintain highest levels of protection,\"  the company said in a statement emailed to CNN., The company said booster doses of its vaccine, developed with BioNTech, produce levels of neutralizing antibodies that are five to 10 times higher than what\'s produced after two doses. And it added that it\'s also developing a new formulation for a booster dose that may protect people from new variants more thoroughly., A Pfizer spokesperson later told CNN the company planned to file for emergency use authorization for a booster dose with the FDA in August. , Cases and hospitalizations are up, CDC chief says, As of Thursday, less than half of the US population -- 47.7% -- was fully vaccinated. The percentage of eligible people who were fully vaccinated -- ages 12 and up -- was 55.8%., Cases and hospitalizations are up especially in parts of the country where vaccination coverage is low, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a White House Covid-19 briefing Thursday., Counties with the highest case rates tended to have low vaccination rates. In the last week, 173 counties had at least 100 cases per 100,000 residents -- and in more than 90% of those counties, vaccination coverage was less than 40%, Walensky said., \"Many of these counties are also the same locations where the Delta variant represents the large majority of circulating virus,\" Walensky said. , \"Low vaccination rates in these counties, coupled with high case rates -- and lax mitigation policies that do not protect those who are unvaccinated from disease -- will certainly, and sadly, lead to more unnecessary suffering, hospitalizations and potentially deaths,\" she added., The case rate has been rising for the US as a whole. The country averaged more than 15,060 new cases a day over a week ending Wednesday -- 20.7% higher than the average from the week prior, according to Johns Hopkins data., The average is still well below this spring\'s peak -- an average of 71,320 daily for a week ending April 14 -- and the pandemic peak average of more than 251,000 daily for a week ending January 8., Covid-19 hospitalizations also have been ticking up recently. The number of Covid-19 patients in US hospitals was nearly 18,000 Tuesday, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. , That\'s slightly above the total of 16,792 two weeks earlier, though well below the pandemic peak of more than 136,000 on January 5., , California positivity rate triples, In California, where state data shows the Delta variant has been identified in roughly 43% of new sequenced specimens, the Covid-19 test positivity rate has tripled in the weeks since the state fully reopened. , The positivity rate has climbed past 2% for the first time since early March, after dropping to an all-time low of just 0.7% in early June. , So far, the influx in infections hasn\'t immediately been reflected in a spike in hospitalizations or deaths -- but officials warn those effects tend to lag behind by a couple of weeks. , Roughly 60% of people statewide have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, state data shows, while more than 9% are partially vaccinated. , 5 largest undervaccinated clusters largely in the South, A new data analysis has identified clusters of unvaccinated people, most of them in the southern United States, that are vulnerable to surges in cases and could become breeding grounds for even more deadly Covid-19 variants., The analysis by researchers at Georgetown University identified 30 clusters of counties with low vaccination rates and significant population sizes. The five most significant of those clusters are sprawled across large swaths of the southeastern United States and a smaller portion in the Midwest. , The five clusters are largely in parts of eight states, starting in the east in Georgia and stretching west to Texas and north to southern Missouri. The clusters include parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Tennessee, and are made up of mostly smaller counties but also cities such as Montgomery, Alabama; Shreveport, Louisiana; and Amarillo, Texas., Most of these states are currently seeing increases in Covid-19 cases. , \"Parts of the country are just as vulnerable if not more vulnerable than they were in December 2020,\" said Shweta Bansal, an associate professor of biology at Georgetown University. Bansal heads up the US COVID-19 Vaccination Tracking project, which has been gathering data on the US vaccine rollout since it began in December. , Vaccinations saved hundreds of thousands of lives in US, researchers say  , In a grim reminder of the scale of the pandemic, the global death toll from Covid-19 has reached more than 4 million, data from Johns Hopkins on Wednesday showed., Three countries account for more than a third of all global deaths. The US, which has the highest number of fatalities at 606,000, accounts for 15% of the global total, followed by Brazil and India., Underscoring vaccines\' effectiveness, researchers say the American toll would have been a lot worse without inoculations., The US would have seen about 279,000 more Covid-19 deaths by June 28 had vaccinations -- which first became available in December -- not have taken place, according to researchers at Yale University and the Commonwealth Fund. The country also would have seen as many as 1.25 million additional hospitalizations, the researchers said. , Fears about more variants if people don\'t get vaccinated, The Delta variant is not the only one worrying health experts. , \"Right now, you want to look at who\'s getting sick, whether from the Delta variant or any other variant: It\'s people who haven\'t been vaccinated,\" Dr. Megan Ranney told CNN on Wednesday., \"I don\'t want it to come to this, but I am hopeful that these surges will drive more people in those states with low vaccination rates to finally go out and get their shot.\" , Vaccinated people don\'t have much to worry about, said Ranney, an emergency physician at Rhode Island Hospital and an associate professor at Brown University. , But she offered an unsettling insight on the current surge of cases., \"What worries me more are the variants yet to come. And every time this virus is passed from one person to another, it has a chance to mutate. And it\'s only a matter of time until we have a variant against which the vaccines no longer protect us,\" she explained. , Some experts have begun asking whether it may be time to start testing vaccinated people to ensure the Delta variant does not evade the effects of vaccines. , Current federal guidelines say fully vaccinated people can refrain from routine testing. Studies and experts have also said the vaccines are still highly protective. , \"I think now we should revisit this policy with the Delta variant and determine if the current recommendations hold up,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, wrote in an email to CNN on Wednesday., The CDC is only reporting data on \"breakthrough\" infections that cause severe disease. That could mean scientists and health officials will not know how many vaccinated people have mild or asymptomatic infections -- and it will be very difficult to track whether a new variant such as Delta is causing more vaccine failure.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/08/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html',1,146),(112,'Updated CDC schools guidance prioritizes in-person learning, even if all Covid-19 safety measures aren\'t in place','The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday updated its Students, teachers and staff who are fully vaccinated do not need to wear masks at school. For those who aren\'t vaccinated or aren\'t eligible, consistent, correct masking remains an important safety measure, the agency said., The CDC says its guidance does not replace local guidance and policies. Schools that are ready to transition away from pandemic precautions should do so gradually, the agency said, as community transmission reaches low levels., \"If localities decide to remove prevention strategies in schools based on local conditions, they should remove them one at a time and monitor closely (with adequate testing) for any increases in COVID-19 cases before removing the next prevention strategy,\" the guidance says, adding that schools need to be transparent with families, staff and the community as they do so. , Vaccines and masks, The CDC suggests schools take steps to promote Covid-19 vaccination, including offering vaccines on site, providing paid sick leave for employees to get vaccinated and excusing absences for students to get vaccinated. Covid-19 vaccines are currently available for people ages 12 and older in the US., While the vaccinated can go without a mask, the agency recommends unvaccinated people over the age of 2 wear masks when indoors. , In general, people don\'t need to wear masks outdoors, but in areas with high coronavirus transmission, people who aren\'t fully vaccinated may still want to wear them in some circumstances., \"Consistent and correct mask use by people who are not fully vaccinated is especially important indoors and in crowded settings, when physical distancing cannot be maintained,\" the CDC notes., Based on local conditions -- for example, in a school where students aren\'t yet eligible for vaccines or in an area with high transmission -- schools can still opt to require universal masking, even for those who are vaccinated. And, the CDC says, schools should still support vaccinated people who choose to wear a mask., Layers of protection, The CDC guidance details layers of ways schools can prevent spread while staying open for in-person learning: \"Screening testing, ventilation, handwashing and respiratory etiquette, staying home when sick and getting tested, contact tracing in combination with quarantine and isolation, and cleaning and disinfection are also important layers of prevention to keep schools safe.\", Physical distancing should be practiced in schools where not everyone is vaccinated, it said, but students should not be excluded from in-person learning in order to maintain physical distancing., Anyone experiencing symptoms that could be Covid-19 or flu should get tested, and stay home if they\'re sick. The guidance says unvaccinated people who were exposed to Covid-19 should quarantine, but fully vaccinated people who don\'t have symptoms do not need to quarantine or get tested after an exposure to a person with Covid-19., Cohorting -- keeping people in small groups that stay together throughout the day -- can be useful to limit contacts, but it doesn\'t replace other key safety measures, the agency says. Cohorting people who are and are not vaccinated separately is not recommended., The agency advises close monitoring of Covid-19 transmission, vaccination coverage, screening testing and outbreaks when making decisions about the prevention strategies needed in their area. , In a White House Covid-19 briefing on Friday, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky sounded the alarm about \"new and concerning trends\" in cases and hospitalizations in areas with low levels of vaccination. , \"Simply put, in areas of low vaccination coverage, cases and hospitalizations are up,\" Walensky said. \"Further, we are seeing some small clusters and larger outbreaks of Covid-19 in locations such as camps and community events where proper, hard-learned prevention strategies are not enforced and the virus is readily able to thrive.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/09/health/cdc-covid-schools-guidance-update/index.html',1,147),(113,'Just one night of sleep loss harms your well-being, new study finds','One night of sleep loss is enough to disrupt your day-to-day mental and physical well-being, according to a new study, and consecutive days of sleep loss can increase these negative impacts. \"Consecutive sleep loss was associated with decreases in positive emotions, increases in negative emotions, and greater frequency of severity of physical symptoms,\" said Soomi Lee, lead author of the study, which published Monday in the Annals of Behavioral Medicine., Lee, an assistant professor at the University of South Florida\'s School of Aging Studies and director of the Sleep, Stress and Health (STEALTH) Lab, studies sleep and the diverse factors that influence it across populations., Adults should get at least seven hours of sleep per night, but 1 in 3 of them don\'t, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The negative effects of poor sleep have been well documented, with its occurrence linked to higher risk of a variety of conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and, in another recent study, dementia. , Daily effects of consecutive sleep loss, however, have not been as widely researched. The new study focused specifically on day-to-day adverse effects of sleep loss, which was defined as getting fewer than six hours of sleep nightly, and whether there are cumulative effects of repeated sleep loss on daily well-being., \"Sleep has been one of the under-recognized health outcomes despite that sleep is very closely related to so many different health outcomes,\" Lee said. , The study, The study examined daily diary data for eight consecutive days from 1,958 adults who took the Midlife in the United States Survey (MIDUS) conducted between 2004 and 2006. , The analysis found that sleep loss for even one night resulted in increased negative well-being and decreased positive well-being, both physically and mentally. Additionally, with multiple consecutive nights of sleep loss, especially after three nights, these effects were amplified. , \"When sleep loss occurs almost every day, which means (it\'s) chronic, that\'s when our body and mind cannot tolerate anymore,\" Lee said. \"The research shows that consecutive sleep loss results in incomplete recovery and stress pile-up and so degrade our daily well-being.\", As the number of consecutive days of sleep loss increased, the severity of adverse physical impacts -- including body aches, gastrointestinal issues and respiratory symptoms, such as a sore throat and runny nose -- also increased, according to the study. , Lee said participants felt the worst physical effects after six consecutive days of sleep loss., Dr. Bhanu Kolla, associate professor of psychiatry and psychology at the Mayo Clinic with a special interest in sleep, said the findings deepen our understanding of the adverse effects of sleep deprivation. He was not involved in the study., This study adds to what we already know, \"which is (that) sleep is one of the pillars of good health, and paying attention to one\'s sleep, giving ourselves enough opportunity to sleep, being aware that if you are sleep-deprived, you are going to feel poorly,\" Kolla said. \"This is likely going to get worse the more sleep-deprived you are, therefore making sleep a priority.\", Kolla said he would like to see how soon the adverse impacts on well-being \"settle down\" once you go back to sleeping normally., The study differs from most previous research since it uses real-world data instead of studying sleep in a laboratory setting, providing additional insight with a larger sample size, he said. The reliance on self-reported data rather than objective measures, however, is not ideal, Kolla added., Looking forward, People don\'t understand how important sleep is for both daily and long-term well-being, Lee said. She added that adult sleep routines affect those of their children and families, so optimal adult sleep is important for the general population\'s health., , \"We have to prioritize our sleep in daily life,\" Lee said. \"Because we are all busy, sleep is often compromised because of other responsibilities.\" , Kolla said the study warrants further research into whether we can help people sleep longer and see if that helps them feel better. It\'s Lee\'s long-term goal to research and develop a sleep promotion and intervention program that is easy for participants and can be implemented in their daily lives. , Her recommendation for individuals to improve their sleep now is to recognize that sleep is one of three pillars of health along with diet and physical exercise. If you keep a regular routine that includes good diet and physical exercise, she said, there would likely be a synergetic effect on daily sleep as well. Lee also recommends sticking to a consistent bedtime and wake time as much as possible.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/09/health/sleep-loss-harms-wellbeing-wellness/index.html',1,148),(114,'Pfizer says it\'s time for a Covid booster; FDA and CDC say not so fast ','Drugmaker Pfizer said Thursday it is seeing waning immunity from its coronavirus vaccine and says it is picking up its efforts to develop a booster dose that will protect people from variants.Pfizer said it would soon publish data about a third dose of vaccine and submit it to the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency and other regulators. The company specified it would seek FDA emergency use authorization for a booster dose in August., But in an unusual move, two top federal agencies said Americans don\'t need boosters yet and said it was not up to companies alone to decide when they might be needed., Hours after Pfizer issued its statement, the FDA and Centers for Disease and Control issued a joint statement saying Americans do not need booster shots yet., \"Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time,\" they said., In a statement to CNN on Friday, the World Health Organization said, \"We don\'t know whether booster vaccines will be needed to maintain protection against COVID-19 until additional data is collected,\" adding, \"limited data available on how long the protection from current doses lasts and whether an additional booster dose would be beneficial and for whom.\", Pfizer and its partner BioNTech said evidence was building that people\'s immunity starts to wane after they have been vaccinated. The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses to provide full immunity., \"As seen in real world data released from the Israel Ministry of Health, vaccine efficacy in preventing both infection and symptomatic disease has declined six months post-vaccination, although efficacy in preventing serious illnesses remains high,\" Pfizer said in a statement emailed to CNN., \"Additionally, during this period the Delta variant is becoming the dominant variant in Israel as well as many other countries. These findings are consistent with an ongoing analysis from the Companies\' Phase 3 study,\" it added., \"While protection against severe disease remained high across the full six months, a decline in efficacy against symptomatic disease over time and the continued emergence of variants are expected.

The Pfizer shot is the cornerstone of vaccination programs in many countries. Two-thirds of doses delivered across the European Union were made by Pfizer, according to the European Center. In Israel, Pfizer is the only vaccine used., Of the 158 million fully vaccinated people in the US, more than half received the Pfizer shot. , US government officials have stressed that fully vaccinated people have a low risk of infection, even from the Delta or B.1.617.2 variant, which is more transmissible than earlier lineages of the virus., Plus, several studies have indicated the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna confer longterm protection., \"FDA, CDC, and NIH (the National Institutes of Health) are engaged in a science-based, rigorous process to consider whether or when a booster might be necessary. This process takes into account laboratory data, clinical trial data, and cohort data -- which can include data from specific pharmaceutical companies, but does not rely on those data exclusively,\" they added., It was a clear message to Pfizer, which has been hinting at the need for a booster shot for months. ,  , \"We continue to review any new data as it becomes available and will keep the public informed. We are prepared for booster doses if and when the science demonstrates that they are needed,\" the CDC and FDA said in the statement., \"The United States is fortunate to have highly effective vaccines that are widely available for those aged 12 and up. People who are fully vaccinated are protected from severe disease and death, including from the variants currently circulating in the country such as Delta,\" the statement continued., \"People who are not vaccinated remain at risk. Virtually all COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are among those who are unvaccinated. We encourage Americans who have not yet been vaccinated to get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and their community.\", Israel\'s health ministry said in a statement earlier this week that it had seen efficacy of Pfizer\'s vaccine drop from more than 90% to about 64% as the B.1.617.2 or Delta variant spread., Pfizer said research showed booster doses of its vaccine, developed with BioNTech, produced levels of neutralizing antibodies that are five to 10 times higher than what\'s produced after two doses., It said it\'s also developing a new formulation for a booster dose that may more thoroughly protect people from new variants., \"While Pfizer and BioNTech believe a third dose of BNT162b2 has the potential to preserve the highest levels of protective efficacy against all currently known variants including Delta, the companies are remaining vigilant and are developing an updated version of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that targets the full spike protein of the Delta variant,\" the company said. Current vaccines target just a piece of the spike protein -- the part of the virus it uses to attach to cells.,  , \"The first batch of the mRNA for the trial has already been manufactured at BioNTech\'s facility in Mainz, Germany. The Companies anticipate the clinical studies to begin in August, subject to regulatory approvals.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/08/health/pfizer-waning-immunity-bn/index.html',1,149),(115,'Covid-19 vaccine boosters may be necessary at some point. Here\'s what you need to know','Vaccine makers are preparing for a next possible phase of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout: booster doses.The biopharmaceutical company Pfizer announced on Thursday that it has seen waning immunity from its coronavirus vaccine -- although efficacy in preventing serious illness remains high -- but did not detail the evidence. It said a third dose may be needed six to 12 months after full vaccination., The company said it would publish \"more definitive data soon\" and in August would seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for a booster dose., But just hours after Pfizer made its announcement, the FDA and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a joint statement saying people who are fully vaccinated do not need booster shots yet., , While boosters are not necessary now, more information is needed to decide whether people might eventually need booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines, and a rise in so-called breakthrough cases could offer a clue in the future, federal vaccine advisers said in June., Members of the CDC\'s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices discussed when it might be time for the agency to make recommendations for booster doses and committee members mostly agreed that more data around the benefits of boosters is needed., ACIP members agreed that a rise in \"breakthrough\" Covid-19 cases, which occur after someone has been fully vaccinated, could be a sign in the future that immunity is waning and booster doses of vaccine may be needed., \"What we are looking for is both a very careful look at breakthrough cases and also whether there is currently an uptick in the elderly -- that would be pretty clear because they are currently so well controlled,\" said ACIP member Dr. Sarah Long, a professor of pediatrics at Drexel University College of Medicine., \"It would be a mistake to be giving booster doses without both some information about number one: Do they boost? And a little bit of safety data,\" Long said. \"So that we would have some idea that there would be benefit of the booster before we might incur unknown risk.\", Currently three coronavirus vaccines are authorized for emergency use in the United States -- the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for people 12 and older, the two-dose Moderna vaccine and the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines for everyone 18 and older., Some researchers and health officials said they suspect the immunity against Covid-19 these vaccines elicit in the body might wane over time -- possibly after a year or more -- and might not protect as well against coronavirus variants that could emerge and evolve., That might mean a vaccinated person would need a booster dose of vaccine to stay protected against the original coronavirus strain and newly emerging variants -- somewhat similar to how a tetanus booster is recommended every 10 years or different flu vaccines are recommended each year., Will booster doses or new vaccines be needed?, \"Many people may be familiar with tetanus-toxoid vaccines that are recommended every 10 years -- that\'s a booster dose. It\'s reminding our immune system so that if we ever got exposed to that toxin, our immune system would remember it and respond very quickly,\" Dr. William Moss, professor and executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told CNN in May., In the case of Covid-19 vaccines it remains unknown for how long immune protection lasts, but vaccine developers and health officials know it may not be forever -- and that emerging variants could escape immunity., \"There is a little nuance with Covid-19 vaccines,\" Moss said., While typical booster doses use same vaccine someone previously received to remind the immune system about immunity to a pathogen, any future boosters for the Covid-19 shot could use different vaccines altogether., , Currently, \"the need for and timing for COVID-19 booster doses have not been established. No additional doses are recommended at this time,\" the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes on its website., But Americans should prepare to have a Covid-19 vaccine booster shot within a year, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer in May, saying \"people should be prepared for the fact that we may need a booster within a year.\", How often will you need a Covid-19 booster?, Despite such predictions, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that the bottom line is \"we don\'t know.\" , \"We\'re preparing for the eventuality that we might need boosters, but I think we\'ve got to be careful not to let the people know that inevitably, x number of months from now, everyone\'s going to need a booster. That\'s just not the case,\" Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, said at a Washington Post Live event in May. \"We may not need it for quite a while.\", Scientists at a number of companies that make Covid-19 vaccines have also predicted the need for boosters within a year -- but the scientific community is not in widespread agreement on this. , So far, studies have shown that mRNA vaccines -- those made by Pfizer and Moderna -- maintain more than 90% efficacy six months after getting vaccinated. And scientists say it\'s likely much longer., Other studies have looked at antibodies in the lab. While a decline is expected over time, Fauci told the Washington Post in May \"the steepness of that slope is unclear right now.\", Experts say it is also unclear how these antibody levels correlate with real-world immunity, and to what extent other parts of the immune system -- such as T cells -- could factor into protection. , What happens if you skip the booster?, Whether booster coronavirus vaccine doses are modified or not, missing a booster dose -- if one is recommended in the future -- could leave someone less protected against Covid-19., , \"A person who skipped a booster is placing themselves at higher risk of getting infected, and getting disease from the SARS-Coronavirus-2, but I would also expect that they\'re going to have some partial immunity and so they may be protected against more severe disease,\" Moss said. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes Covid-19., \"They\'re just at higher risk of infection and disease than someone who got the booster, but they have more immunity than someone who was never vaccinated.\", Scientists are also currently investigating whether it makes a difference if someone gets the same type of vaccine as a booster as the original dose administered., \"This question of mixing and matching certainly is relevant to booster doses,\" Moss said. \"It\'s also relevant to any two-dose vaccine schedule, and it\'s also an area of active research.\", , Researchers in the United Kingdom reported in May that people who got mixed doses of coronavirus vaccines -- receiving a different vaccine type as a second dose than the first dose -- appear to be more likely to experience mild side effects such as fever, chills, fatigue or headache., But the side effects following mix-and-match vaccinations were short-lived and there were no other safety concerns, the researchers reported in the Lancet medical journal. , Currently, the CDC says, \"Covid-19 vaccines are not interchangeable\" and there has been no decision either in the US or globally on the need for booster doses yet, let alone which vaccine might be appropriate for any booster., Who is making booster shots?, All three companies that currently have authorized coronavirus vaccines in the United States -- Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson -- are investigating the potential use of boosters., \"The data that I see coming, they are supporting the notion that likely there will be a need for a booster somewhere between eight and 12 months,\" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told Axios in May. \"But that remains to be seen and I believe in one, two months we will have enough data to speak about it with much higher scientific certainty.\", The first dose of Pfizer\'s coronavirus vaccine in the United States was administered on December 14, 2020 -- five months ago. As time goes on, if people received their second dose of vaccine eight months ago, \"they may need a third one,\" Bourla said. \"This could be coming sooner than later, I believe from September, October. But this is something, again, that the data need to confirm.\", Moderna is currently conducting booster shot trials too., , The fight against the coronavirus pandemic is expected to continue through next year due to the emergence of variants, Dr. Stephen Hoge, president of Moderna, said during an earnings call in early May., \"We think this is just the beginning,\" Hoge said. \"Therefore, we\'re committed as a company to make as many updates to the vaccine, to add as many variants as we think are necessary, to ensure that when people receive a booster, it provides the broadest immune protection against the widest range of variants.\", Johnson &amp; Johnson is also looking into the potential for boosters., \"We have ongoing and planned trials that will aid our assessment of the need for, and timing of, booster doses of our vaccine,\" according to an emailed statement Johnson &amp; Johnson sent to CNN in May. , Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s coronavirus vaccine, along with Pfizer\'s, Moderna\'s, and four others, are being tested as seasonal boosters in a study called Cov-Boost being conducted by the UK\'s National Institute for Health Research and the University of Southhampton. , , The biotechnology company Novavax has developed a coronavirus vaccine that its chief executive officer Stanley Erck believes could be used as a booster shot for people who have already been vaccinated. The company plans to apply for emergency use authorization of its vaccine in the United States in the third quarter of 2021. , \"In the US, I think it will be the booster for everyone, particularly if we get it out late in the third quarter,\" Erck told CNN in May. \"It\'s going to be time to start boosting -- whether it\'s six months or at a year point.\", Who has to OK the Covid-19 booster shots?, The decision to use Covid-19 boosters is expected to involve two agencies -- the FDA and the CDC -- and the regulatory process to get the shots into arms could vary depending on whether the booster is the same vaccine that was originally used or is a modified version., \"So, if it\'s the same vaccine, my understanding is that what would have to happen is that the CDC would have to recommend an additional dose with details around when that should occur,\" Moss said. , If it\'s a modified vaccine, \"this is where things get interesting and I don\'t think we quite know,\" he said, but added that the regulatory process could be similar to what happens with flu vaccines each year. , \"Technically, whenever a vaccine like that is modified, it\'s often considered a new vaccine and has to go through the whole process again. But there is a precedent, obviously, with influenza virus vaccines, not to do that,\" Moss said. \"So, the influenza vaccine each year doesn\'t have to go through a large Phase 3 trial.\", That\'s because the vaccine technology stays the same, and the only change is the flu virus itself that the vaccine targets to elicit immunity to a specific flu virus strain that\'s circulating. , \"At this time, available information suggests that the FDA-authorized vaccines remain effective in protecting the American public against currently circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. However, if there is an emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variant(s) in the U.S. that are moderately or fully resistant to the antibody response elicited by the current generation of COVID-19 vaccines, it may be necessary to tailor the vaccines to the variant(s),\" an FDA spokesperson told CNN in May., The FDA updated its guidance for vaccine developers in February, noting that manufacturers should \"generate the data to support authorization\" of a modified vaccine. , \"Further discussions will be necessary to decide whether in the future, modified COVID-19 vaccines may be authorized without the need for clinical studies,\" according to the guidance. But overall, vaccine developers are \"encouraged\" to perform exploratory studies on modified vaccines to boost immune responses., Would some people benefit more from boosters than others?, Some research suggests that people who are immune compromised could benefit from booster doses of vaccine., For instance, organ transplant recipients might not have an adequate response to coronavirus vaccines because they take drugs to suppress their immune systems. That helps reduce the risk of the body rejecting new organs but may also limit responses to vaccines., A third dose of coronavirus vaccine could help boost antibody levels among some organ transplant recipients who have not had robust responses to the standard vaccination schedules, according to a study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine in June., Among patients in the study who had no measurable antibodies after receiving two doses of vaccine, one-third of them saw a rise in antibodies after a third dose -- and among those with low antibody levels after two doses, all of them saw an increase after a third dose. , When it comes to coronavirus vaccines, \"we don\'t really have a good sense of what level you need for protective immunity,\" Dr. Dorry Segev, an author of the study and founder of the Epidemiology Research Group in Organ Transplantation at Johns Hopkins University, told CNN. \"We don\'t know if you need the same off-the-charts level of antibodies that people with normal immune systems have.\", But for transplant patients, after a two-dose full vaccine series, \"the overwhelming majority have either no antibodies or low antibodies,\" Segev said., When pharmaceutical companies tested coronavirus vaccines in clinical trials last year, they specifically excluded people who were taking immunosuppressive drugs due to potential risks., \"There\'s no data to support recommendations for a booster dose at this time, except for the caveat in severely immunocompromised hosts who are not able to mount a strong response or no response at all,\" ACIP member Dr. Sharon Frey said during a committee meeting in June., For that high-risk group, \"I would lean towards giving at least one more or third vaccination using the mRNA vaccines or a second Janssen, whatever the case may be,\" said Frey, who is a vaccine specialist at St Louis University Medical School.  , But when it comes to the general public, \"we really, truly need to wait for more data,\" Frey said. \"I think the only thing we can do at this moment is, if we start to see an uptick in reinfections in people, or new infections in people who have been vaccinated, that\'s our clue that we need to move quickly.\", , The ACIP panel considered that there are some groups of people -- immunocompromised patients, long-term care facility residents, older adults, and health care personnel -- who may benefit from booster doses more than the general public., \"I have personally seen people die well after two full doses of mRNA vaccine because, we believe, they were immunocompromised and didn\'t have full protection,\" said ACIP member Dr. Camille Kotton, who cares for immunocompromised patients at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School., \"So, for me, this is the next important frontier that we really need to deal with and as rapidly as possible,\" Kotton said about booster doses., Kotton encouraged her colleagues on the committee to consider proceeding with recommendations for booster shots \"as soon as we have good science\" available on which to base decisions., \"I would wait for the additional data to be available, including the safety data as well,\" Kotton said, adding, \"This is a hot topic.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/23/health/covid-19-vaccine-boosters-questions-update-wellness/index.html',1,151),(116,'How to safely exercise outdoors when it\'s hot out ','There is nothing quite like an alfresco workout, with its fresh air and changing scenery. But when temperatures soar, beware. Exercising in hot weather stresses your body, especially if the humidity is high. If you do not take proper precautions, it can actually be dangerous, and potentially lethal. The number of heat-related deaths while participating in sports has doubled in the United States since 1975, according to the National Institutes of Health. And the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that some 650 people die from extreme heat every year. , So if you are planning to head outside when the temperature is climbing, keep these tips in mind., Important note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain., Watch the time of day, You may love exercising over the noon hour, but that\'s a terrible time to head outside when it\'s hot. No matter what climate you are in, schedule your workouts for early morning or evening, when heat and ozone levels are lower. And definitely do not go out between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., when the sun is overhead, and temperatures are at their peak., Know your risk level, Risk factors for heat-related illness include age (4 and under and 65+), obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, mental illness, diabetes, and prescription drug and alcohol use. Where you are working out may be a factor, too; the bulk of heat-related deaths in the US occur in Arizona, California and Texas, according to the CDC. Knowing your fitness level is also important. If you are out of shape or new to exercise, you may be more prone to heat issues., Dress properly, Wear loose, lightweight and light-colored clothing to help keep the heat at bay. Add a light, broad-brimmed hat and sunglasses, if possible. Do not forget the sunscreen -- which you should regularly reapply -- as a sunburn can be dehydrating, plus it hampers your body\'s ability to cool down., Acclimate to the heat, Just as you need to acclimate your body to a higher elevation, you also need to help your body adjust to the heat, especially if you normally exercise indoors or in cooler weather. Acclimate by shortening your workouts and lowering their intensity for a week or two once it\'s consistently hot outside. , Subscribe to CNN\'s Fitness, But Better newsletter: Get back in the groove. Sign up for our newsletter series to ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts, Stay hydrated , Being well hydrated is key to preventing heat illness, whether you are exercising outside or sitting around indoors. So keep tabs on your hydration level at all times. The CDC recommends drinking eight ounces of water every 15 to 20 minutes when you are out in the heat., To achieve this, carry water with you and drink regularly, even if you are not thirsty. For once you find yourself thirsty, you are already at least slightly dehydrated. If you struggle to down water, try a sports drink instead. Or eat some fruit., \"Drinking water isn\'t the only way to stay hydrated,\" said Stephen Phillips, a certified personal trainer at Atlanta\'s Berman Center, a mental health and substance abuse treatment facility. \"Eat more foods that are full of water, like cucumbers and watermelon, either beforehand or during the workout.\", Get creative, Take a cool or cold shower before working out to help your body stay cooler for a longer period of time. You can also use a hydration pack, said Tom Gil, a certified real estate copywriter and marketing consultant who once trained in the scorching Jordan Rift Valley as a member of the Israeli Special Forces. , \"They help by having cold water lean against your body, lowering its temperature, and they have a long straw reaching your mouth,\" which helps you hydrate quickly and easily, said Gil via email., Pace yourself, Even if you have acclimated to the heat, are hydrated, and have the proper clothing and gear, you still need to pace yourself. Do your interval training at a slightly slower pace than normal, shorten your workouts and take regular breaks in the shade. If you are struggling at all, or if temperatures hit 90 degrees Fahrenheit, Gil recommended heading indoors., \"When temperatures reach 32 Celsius or 89.5 Fahrenheit -- all heavy military workouts, drills and combat simulations stop,\" he said. \"The Israeli military learned it the hard way -- losing soldiers to heat strokes in training.\" , Know the signs of heat distress, Symptoms of heat-related illness include muscle cramps, nausea or vomiting, weakness, fatigue, headache, excessive sweating, dizziness, confusion, irritability, visual problems and increased heart rate. If you experience any of these, stop exercising immediately, get out of the heat and hydrate. Once in the shade and drinking water, wet a towel or bandanna and place it on your neck, forehead and underarms. If you do not feel better after 20 minutes, head to urgent care., Use the buddy system, When the temperature soars, grab a friend to work out with you. That way, you can monitor each other for heat distress. Sometimes too much heat can cause confusion, so you may not realize you are struggling. But your buddy may be able to spot your distress and help get you to safety.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/09/health/hot-weather-exercise-tips-wellness/index.html',1,152),(117,'Scientists condemn UK\'s \'dangerous and unethical\' reopening plans','Calling it a \"dangerous and unethical experiment,\" more than 4,000 scientists, doctors, nurses and other professionals signed a letter published Wednesday condemning the British government\'s plans to drop most pandemic control measures in England on Monday, July 19.\"We believe this decision is dangerous and premature,\" they wrote in a letter to the Lancet medical journal., \"The UK Government must reconsider its current strategy and take urgent steps to protect the public, including children.

This would mean the lifting of laws on masks, social distancing, and instructions to work from home., Current restrictions include maintaining a distance of \"one-meter plus,\" the use of face coverings on public transport and inside enclosed public spaces, a cap on the number of attendees at weddings and funerals, the continued closure of nightclubs, and scanning in and out of cafes and restaurants., Epidemiologists have instead urged the government to adopt smarter policies like continued mask use and investment in ventilation in schools and workplaces, while allowing more time for greater vaccination coverage before lifting measures., \"Contrary to the statements of government scientists, there is no scientific consensus over the government\'s current plans to remove protective mandates on July 19. Instead, there is deep disagreement,\" Lancet editor Dr. Richard Horton said in a statement., , , \"Many scientists are sincerely concerned that with sub-optimal double-vaccination numbers and rapidly rising transmission rates, we are at a very dangerous moment in the pandemic. Removing mandates on July 19 will not only accelerate virus transmission, with substantial increased levels of acute illness, hospitalization, and long COVID, but also create the conditions for the emergence of new variants that could escape vaccine protection.\", Dr. Eric Topol, an outspoken cardiologist and director of the Scripps Research Translational Unit in La Jolla, California, also signed the letter. \"The abrupt rise in UK Delta variant cases will not only engender more long Covid, but has also already resulted in more severe illness, with hospitalizations and deaths. Taking more time to further improve vaccination rates should help reduce the toll of this superspreader strain,\" Topol said in a statement., , , The British Medical Association has also objected to the plans., On Wednesday, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official urged caution in dropping restrictions. \"We would ask governments at this moment not to lose the gains you\'ve made,\" Dr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO\'s emergencies program, told reporters during a meeting from Geneva., Without naming specific countries, Ryan said it was a \"dangerous assumption\" that countries that have vaccinated a large proportion of their populations can control surges in hospitalizations and deaths. , According to the British government, 86.4% of adult residents have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine and 64.6% are fully vaccinated., More than 32,000 new infections were reported in the UK Wednesday, with a sharp increase in new cases reported for July. The country has been one of the worst affected in Europe during the pandemic, with more than 128,000 deaths and almost 5 million cases., This story has been updated to clarify that the 86.4% of Britons who have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine are adults.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/07/health/uk-opening-scientist-letter/index.html',1,154),(118,'US death rates are falling for many types of cancer, but not all, report says','US death rates from cancer continued to decline from 2014 to 2018, driven mostly by drops in deaths from lung cancer and melanoma, according to a new report published Thursday. But America\'s collective lack of exercise and poor diet may have driven increases in certain other cancers, including pancreatic cancer and breast cancer, the report found., Overall deaths from cancer declined 2.2% in men and 1.7% in women over four years. Declines were consistent across all ethnicities and races, the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer found., Deaths from lung cancer and melanoma saw \"accelerated\" declines compared to other cancers. Researchers said the drop in lung cancer death rates drove the overall decline, and the melanoma decline represented a \"substantial increase in survival for metastatic melanoma.\", \"The declines in lung cancer and melanoma death rates are the result of progress across the entire cancer continuum - from reduced smoking rates to prevent cancer to discoveries such as targeted drug therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors,\" Karen Knudsen, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, said in a news release., The survival rate for advanced melanoma cancer has \"substantially\" improved since 2009, said Farhad Islami, lead author on the report and scientific director for cancer disparity research with the American Cancer Society., \"The two-year survival rate for melanoma, advanced melanoma in 2009 was about 27%, this increased to about 44% in 2014, which is about a 60% increase in the survival rate,\" he said. , The report is put together by the American Cancer Society, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Cancer Institute, the National Institutes of Health and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.

Death rates rose for brain and nervous system cancers and pancreatic cancers. , While death rates declined for all groups, cancer death rates were still higher among Black people than in White people, even though incidence rates were lower in Black people than in White people., \"The continuing disparity largely reflects a combination of multiple intertwined factors of tumor biology, stage at diagnosis, receipt of timely and effective treatment, and systemic discrimination in cancer care delivery,\" the report reads. \"Furthermore, largely owing to social determinants of health inequalities, Black persons and individuals of lower socioeconomic groups in general are more likely to have a higher exposure to some cancer risk factors and limited access to healthy food, safe places for physical activity, and evidence-based cancer preventive services.\", Cancer incidence rates increased for pancreatic, kidney and female breast cancers, which researchers suggested may be linked to a \"staggering\" rise in obesity and total sitting time., \"We see that most of the cancer types that are increasing, those are obesity-related cancers,\"  Islami said. , \"We see that increasing trend for many of the obesity-related cancers in those younger ages,\" he said. \"So we think that at least a proportion of the increase in rates are attributable to increases in excess body weight and obesity.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/08/health/us-cancer-deaths-decline/index.html',1,155),(119,'Covid-19 vaccines saved nearly 280,000 lives in the US, new research estimates','Covid-19 vaccines saved hundreds of thousands of lives and prevented more than a million hospitalizations in the United States, according to new estimates from researchers at Yale University and the Commonwealth Fund. The researchers compared actual trends in Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths against a modeled trajectory of what those trends would have been if there had been no vaccinations. , By the end of June, the researchers estimate that there would have been about 279,000 additional deaths due to Covid-19 -- about 46% more than there were -- and as many as 1.25 million additional hospitalizations if there were no vaccinations. And if vaccinations had progressed at half the pace that they did, about 121,000 more people may have died and more than 450,000 more would have been hospitalized. , At a briefing Thursday, White House Covid-19 response director Jeff Zients called this new research \"a powerful reminder about what\'s at stake in our vaccination efforts.\", \"This is further evidence that our whole-of-government strategy is working and has prevented significant further tragedy and disruption to Americans\' lives and livlihoods,\" he said., The researchers\' model considered factors including the prevalence and transmissibility of new variants, vaccine efficacy rates, mobility patterns driving daily contacts and age-specific risks of severe health outcomes due to Covid-19. , Most of the additional deaths would have occurred because of an \"increase and spread of the more transmissible Alpha variant,\" according to the researchers. The Alpha variant -- also known as B.1.1.7 and first identified in the UK -- became the dominant strain in the US in the spring. Without vaccinations, the researchers estimate there could have been a spring surge with nearly 4,500 deaths each day, even more than the January peak of about 3,400 daily deaths. , The researchers compared their model against actual trends between mid-December 2020 -- when vaccinations began in the US -- and the end of June 2021. However, the model was simulated using data back through October 2020 to balance lower incidence rates with the those from winter surge. , Nearly 48% of the US population -- about 156 million people -- are fully vaccinated, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

That could mean scientists and health officials will not know how many vaccinated people have mild or asymptomatic infections -- and it will be very difficult to track whether a new variant such as Delta is causing more vaccine failure., \"We need to design studies. Assuming this is underway, then the question comes, do we wait for those studies or change recommendations now and reconsider regular testing for asymptomatic vaccinated individuals? Given how disruptive this is, I would probably be inclined to wait for additional data before going backwards,\" Hotez wrote. , \"The good news is that the mRNA vaccines are still highly protective against serious illness even for Delta.\" , , The mRNA vaccines are made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. Johnson &amp; Johnson has also reported evidence its vaccine is protective against Delta, also known as B.1.617.2., Because vaccines are still highly protective, other experts argue there is no need to change guidance. , \"I still think that the pre-test probability of a positive COVID test in people who are vaccinated and asymptomatic is very small. So much so that you would worry about false positives,\" Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\'s Hospital in Philadelphia, told CNN on Wednesday., Overall, data on Covid-19 cases caused by the Delta variant among vaccinated people are hard to come by -- especially when seeking cases that may be asymptomatic. As of May, the CDC transitioned from monitoring all \"breakthrough\" Covid-19 cases among vaccinated people to only tracking cases that result in hospitalization or death. , , In Israel, the Ministry of Health issued a brief statement Monday saying an analysis had shown the coronavirus vaccine was somewhat less protective against severe disease than before, and linked the drop to the spread of the Delta variant of the virus., Israel widely deployed the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine., The statement said that as of June 6, the vaccine provided 64% protection against all infections, including asymptomatic infection and mild disease, and a drop to 93% efficacy in preventing severe disease and hospitalizations., Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he would like to see more data on the Israeli findings before deciding the Delta variant in fact eludes the protection offered by vaccines., , \"We need to get more granular and specific data from the Israelis,\" Fauci told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper., While \"the Israelis know what they\'re doing,\" the data is sparse, Fauci added., The Israeli government has not yet released new data or any other background to support the findings., \"We want to make sure exactly what the circumstances were of that drop from 94% protection against asymptomatic infection down to 64,\" Fauci said. \"Is that a reflection that they\'re more aggressively testing everybody and anybody who\'s come into contact with a person who has an asymptomatic infection? I don\'t know.\", \'We fully expect to see more cases, especially among unvaccinated\', In the United States, \"breakthrough\" cases among vaccinated people are so rare that many state health departments CNN has contacted have not collected enough data to determine any patterns or trends yet that could result in a change in testing guidance. , For instance, Louisiana confirmed to CNN in an email on Wednesday that state epidemiologists have an analysis of breakthrough cases currently underway -- but need more sequencing data to be confident in sharing state-level estimates., \"However, we fully expect to see more cases, especially among unvaccinated individuals, as the proportion of Delta circulating in Louisiana increases,\" Kevin Litten, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Health, wrote in the email., Similarly to other states, Arkansas has seen a \"significant increase\" in Covid-19 cases caused by the Delta variant, Danyelle McNeill, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Health, told CNN in an email on Tuesday. , , Overall, \"we have seen an increase in the number of new cases in our state. Additionally, we have seen an increase in the proportion and number of samples that have been identified as the delta variant,\" McNeill wrote in the email. , But as of now, \"due to lack of variant information on all of our current cases, we are unable to attribute the increase in the number of cases to the delta variant,\" McNeill said. \"It is difficult to say if this is a causal relationship.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/07/health/covid-19-test-vaccinated-delta-wellness/index.html',1,158),(121,'When should vaccinated people wear masks now? An expert weighs in','The Delta variant, a more transmissible -- and potentially more dangerous -- strain of coronavirus, now makes up This variant, combined with low rates of vaccination in many parts of the country, is leading to new surges in Covid-19 cases, which has led to Los Angeles County and St. Louis-area health officials encouraging even people who are fully vaccinated to wear masks indoors. The World Health Organization has issued similar guidance (the CDC has continued to say that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks under most circumstances). , , , To clear up confusion about masking, we turned to CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen for her thoughts. Wen is an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She\'s also author of a new book out later this month, \"Lifelines: A Doctor\'s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.\", CNN: Are there circumstances in which vaccinated people should return to wearing masks indoors?  , Dr. Leana Wen: Yes. Masks are still required in some settings, such as airports, on planes and trains, and in hospitals. If a business requires masks, you should still wear a mask, so it\'s a good practice to carry a mask around with you in case you need it., The more difficult question becomes, what about settings where you don\'t have to wear a mask -- when might you choose to wear one? Here are the factors I\'d consider., First is your health and the vaccination status of those in your household. If you are immunocompromised, you should be wearing a mask in all indoor settings where you could be exposed to unvaccinated people. , If you live with someone who is immunocompromised or with young, unvaccinated children, you might still want to take additional precautions. Your chance of contracting Covid-19 and passing it on to your family is much lower once you\'re vaccinated, but it\'s not zero. Consider wearing a mask in high-risk settings, such as crowded grocery stores or indoor church services., , , Second is the level of coronavirus infection and the rate of vaccination in your community. These two are generally correlated: The areas with higher rates of vaccination also tend to have lower levels of infection. , If you\'re living in an area where over 80% of adults are vaccinated, and the Covid-19 rates are very low, your chances of encountering an unvaccinated, infected person is greatly reduced. You are probably safer going without a mask there compared to, say, if you\'re living in an area with less than 30% of adults vaccinated and where the Delta variant is surging., CNN: Some people reading this will ask, \"Why are we even talking about masks again, when the vaccines are supposed to work so well?\" , Wen: The Covid-19 vaccines we have in the US do work very well. But no vaccine works 100% of the time. Think of the vaccine as a very effective raincoat. If it\'s drizzling, you\'ll be protected. If the rain is coming down hard, you might still be fine. But if you are going in and out of rainstorms all the time, you could end up getting wet., , , Risk is cumulative. If you have multiple encounters every day with unvaccinated people, and there is a high level of community transmission in your area, your chances of having a breakthrough infection after vaccination will increase. You can reduce that risk by wearing a mask in the highest risk settings., CNN: What if you\'re going to work and everyone in your office is vaccinated? Do you still need to wear a mask if there\'s no distancing? , Wen: Good question. We know that vaccination dramatically reduces your likelihood of becoming infected and of being an asymptomatic carrier who could transmit the virus to others. Your chance of becoming infected from a vaccinated person, if you\'re also vaccinated, is virtually zero. Going to an office where everyone around you is known to be vaccinated, even without masks and distancing, is very safe., CNN: What about the reverse -- what if you have to be back at work, but vaccinations aren\'t required? Should you mask up? , Wen: That depends on the other factors we discussed. Consider your health, then the likelihood that someone at work could be infected based on community transmission and vaccination rates in your area. Also consider the circumstances at work. Are the people you are in close contact with vaccinated? Let\'s say that your workplace doesn\'t have a vaccination policy, but the two people who share your office or the three people with cubicles closest to you are fully vaccinated. That would be a pretty safe environment, and you probably don\'t need to be wearing a mask at your desk.  , , , On the other hand, if you are asked to go into cramped, poorly ventilated conference rooms with people who you doubt are vaccinated, consider wearing a mask there, or, better yet, see if you could attend the meeting virtually., CNN: Does the type of mask matter? , Wen: If you are immunocompromised and are in a high-risk setting, you should be wearing an N95 or KN95 mask or double-masking. Otherwise, a well-fitting 3-ply surgical mask should be sufficient, though if you\'re comfortable with the N95 or KN95, there is no harm to wearing that in crowded indoor settings. , CNN: Are there any outdoor settings where you\'d recommend a vaccinated person wear a mask? , Wen: Not at the moment. The ventilation that comes with being outdoors reduces transmission so much, as does vaccination. A person who is severely immunocompromised may still wish to wear a mask at crowded ball games or concerts, but otherwise, outdoor masking should not be needed for vaccinated people. , CNN: What if people assume that you\'re unvaccinated because you\'re putting on a mask?, Wen: A lot of people who are vaccinated and want to be extra cautious are wearing masks. It could even be that the people wearing a mask in public places are actually vaccinated, and it\'s the people who are unvaccinated who are walking around unmasked. You should focus on doing what makes you comfortable. If you\'d feel more comfortable wearing a mask in some settings, you should do that. , , , , CNN: How does the Delta variant affect your recommendation?, Wen: Now that more than half of new infections in the US are caused by this variant, you should assume that if you were to come into contact with someone with Covid-19, it\'s the Delta variant you\'re encountering. This variant is more transmissible than any of the previous variants. There is some evidence that those infected with the Delta variant also carry more virus, thus making them more likely to infect others. The vaccines we have do appear to be effective against the Delta variant, though less effective than they are against other strains. , , , CNN: To be clear, unvaccinated people still need to wear masks?, Wen: Right. The guidance for unvaccinated people has not changed. If unvaccinated people are around other people who are unvaccinated -- or people who are of unknown vaccination status -- they should be wearing masks indoors. Outdoors, the risk of transmission is low, so no masks are needed there. This applies to kids too, so children under the age of 12 who are not eligible to be vaccinated should still be wearing masks indoors when around other unvaccinated kids., With the Delta variant on the rise, I would be even more vigilant than before. If there is a situation where you\'re on the fence about whether to put on your mask, I would err on the side of caution and just do it., ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/08/health/indoor-mask-wearing-coronavirus-vaccine-wen-wellness/index.html',1,159),(122,'Five undervaccinated clusters put the entire United States at risk','A new data analysis identifies clusters of unvaccinated people, most of them in the southern United States, that are vulnerable to surges in Covid-19 cases and could become breeding grounds for even more deadly Covid-19 variants.  The analysis by researchers at Georgetown University identified 30 clusters of counties with low vaccination rates and significant population sizes. The five most significant of those clusters are sprawled across large swaths of the southeastern United States and a smaller portion in the Midwest.  , The five clusters are largely in parts of eight states, starting in the east in Georgia and stretching west to Texas and north to southern Missouri. The clusters also include parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Tennessee, and are made up of mostly smaller counties but also cities such as Montgomery, Alabama; Shreveport, Louisiana; and Amarillo, Texas.  , Most of these states are currently seeing increases in Covid-19 cases.  , \"Parts of the country are just as vulnerable if not more vulnerable than they were in December, 2020,\" said Shweta Bansal, an associate professor of biology at Georgetown University. Bansal heads up the US COVID-19 Vaccination Tracking project, which has been gathering data on the US vaccine rollout since it began in December.  , Those vulnerable clusters put all of the United States -- and to some extent, the world -- at risk for going back to 2020, since high-transmission areas can become breeding grounds for Covid-19 variants that could go on to evade Covid-19 vaccines.  , \"These clusters of unvaccinated people are what is standing in the way of us putting this virus down permanently,\" said Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a CNN medical analyst and professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University.  , Millions of unvaccinated people in the clusters   , About one-third of Americans have not received even a single Covid-19 shot -- and the Georgetown analysis shows that these people are not evenly spread around the United States.  , Analyzing county vaccination data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state health departments, the Georgetown researchers found 30 clusters of counties throughout the US that have low vaccination rates compared to the national average and also have significant population size.  , The five most significant clusters together include more than 15 million people. Of those, only 27.9% are fully vaccinated -- far lower than the national rate of 47.6%.   , The county data is not without its flaws. When someone gets a shot, their home county is supposed to be noted in state records, but the system doesn\'t always work perfectly. In the Georgetown analysis, at least 90% of all vaccinations were recorded with the person\'s home county, Bansal said.  , In some cases, the Georgetown data differs from CDC data because Bansal and her team were able to obtain additional data directly from state health departments. , While the clusters do encompass some sizable cities, 92% of the counties in the clusters have a population of less than 100,000.  , The federal government has been engaging with churches and organizations such as the YMCA to encourage Covid-19 vaccination in areas like these, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN.  , \"These are extraordinary partners in reaching communities [in rural areas] where health care access isn\'t as easy as it is in urban areas,\" he said.  , Clusters give virus opportunities to mutate , The Delta variant, which now comprises more than half the cases in the United States, is the latest in a long string of Covid-19 variants that have spread more easily and in some cases caused more severe illness.  , That\'s why the clusters are so worrisome. Each time a virus spreads, it has an opportunity to learn how to mutate.  , \"We know that if you give the virus the opportunity to circulate and replicate, you give it the opportunity to generate more variants,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden\'s chief medical adviser, told CNN.  , The Delta variant has learned how to evade Covid-19 vaccines to a small degree, but they still offer excellent protection against severe disease and hospitalization.  , The fear is that the next variant might be able to outsmart the vaccine more thoroughly, causing problems even for parts of the country that have high vaccination rates.  , \"We\'ve been lucky with the variants so far that they\'ve been relatively susceptible to our vaccine, but the more you roll the dice, the more opportunities there will be for a resistant variant,\" Reiner said.

Arkansas had fully vaccinated 34.6% of its total population as of Tuesday, CDC data shows., Overall, data shows that Covid-19 is expected to swell in less vaccinated communities, especially as the Delta variant continues to spread in those areas., \"If ever there was a reason to get vaccinated, this is it,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN on Tuesday., Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, added that America has ample vaccine supply, but there is still a significant portion of people who don\'t want the shots., \"There are places in the world, where people would do anything to get vaccine, and yet we have a substantial proportion of people in very specific regions of the country who just do not want to get vaccinated,\" he added., In response to the more contagious Delta variant, the Biden administration said it would deploy response teams comprising officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to areas with a high spread of the virus and low vaccination rates., In Missouri, the surge team will include an epidemiologist, research assistants, a health communication specialist, contact tracers and others who will help with vaccination and outreach, according to the health department., \"More team members will be added, both remotely and in person, to assist with data and research, vaccine uptake strategies and outreach,\" said Lisa Cox, a communications director with the Missouri health department., 100% of Maryland deaths last month were unvaccinated people, In June, all Covid-19 deaths in Maryland occurred in unvaccinated people, according to a tweet Tuesday by Michael Ricci, communications director for Gov.

This has now been fully approved by the FDA,\' and even though it\'s got a great record already, that will I think be another stamp of approval,\" Slavitt said., The FDA does not comment on pending approvals, but officials across the Biden administration have said they expect the agency to grant full approval., Currently, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s Covid-19 vaccines are administered under Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA., A recent survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that 31% of adults who have yet to get vaccinated would be more likely to get a shot that has been fully approved by the FDA. The report polled 1,888 US adults., Study finds prolonged changes to resting heart rate and sleep, People infected with Covid-19 may experience changes to their resting heart rate that last for months, in addition to changes in sleep duration and step count, according to data published Wednesday., The study, published in JAMA Network Open, used wearables to track biometric data from 875 people -- 234 who tested positive for Covid-19 over the course of the study and 641 who tested negative., Researchers observed the largest difference in the resting heart rate of positive participants versus negative. Covid-19 positive participants showed an intermittent slowed heart rate followed by an extended elevated heart rate which \"did not return to baseline, on average, until 79 days after symptom onset,\" according to the study., \"Individuals with Covid-19 took longer to return to their (resting heart rate), sleep, and activity baselines compared with symptomatic individuals who were Covid-19 negative,\" said the study authors, who are affiliated with Scripps research., For just over 13% of the Covid-19 positive patients, these effects lasted even longer. In 32 participants, resting heart rate remained more than 5 beats per minute higher than their baseline for over 133 days., Covid-positive participants showed an increase in sleep duration which lasted an average of 32 days after symptom onset, and a decrease in step count which lasted an average of 24 days., \"We found a prolonged physiological impact of COVID-19 infection, lasting approximately 2 to 3 months, on average, but with substantial intraindividual variability, which may reflect various levels of autonomic nervous system dysfunction or potentially ongoing inflammation,\" the authors wrote., The study collected only Covid-19 symptom data in the acute phase of the infection, which limited researchers\' ability to compare long-term physiological changes with long-term symptoms., Another study finds people more likely to have health complications if they had a severe case of Covid-19 , Vaccines are not only effective in preventing severe illness from Covid-19, they also prevent its long-term health effects, according to experts., People who were severely ill with Covid-19 are twice as likely to need to go back to the hospital for a Covid-19-related complication in the future compared to patients who had mild or moderate symptoms, according to a new study from the University of Florida., The researchers examined patient records for nearly 11,000 people treated in their health system. Of those patients, 114 had severe Covid-19 and needed to be hospitalized. Another 211 had mild or moderate Covid-19., The other patients were treated for unrelated health problems.

Here\'s what scientists know about the most common among them:, Delta, As of July 3, the Delta variant accounted for 51.7% of cases in the US, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., By mid-June, the Delta variant accounted for 99% of Covid-19 cases in the UK, according to Public Health England, and it is set to account for 90% of cases in Europe by the end of August, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control., The World Health Organization reports the Delta variant has been detected in 100 countries. It has overtaken the worrying Beta, or B.1.351 variant, in South Africa., , , \"Delta is the most transmissible of the variants identified so far,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last month., \"We know that the Delta variant has increased transmissibility and it is currently surging in pockets of the country with low vaccination rates,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told a White House briefing Thursday., \"In parts of the Midwest and upper mountain states, CDCs early sequence data suggests the Delta variant accounts for approximately 80% of cases,\" she added., What makes it so much more transmissible? It carries a cluster of mutations on the spike protein—the part of the virus used to attach to the cells it attacks -- that appear to make it more effective at getting into cells, where it can replicate. , , , On Wednesday, a team of Chinese researchers reported people infected with Delta carried viral loads -- the amount of virus in their bodies -- that were 1,200 times higher than people infected with older lineages., It also appears to reach a point where it can be transmitted two days earlier, on average, after infection, the researchers said in their report, posted online., However, multiple studies indicate all three vaccines authorized for use in the US can protect people against Delta. They all show the vaccines generate a cushion of protection that more than makes up for the variant\'s ability to compete with the immune response. They don\'t prevent all infections, but greatly reduce the likelihood of severe disease, hospitalization and death., , , Delta does evade the immune system, which may mean people who have been infected once with an older variant may be more likely to catch it again. It also eludes the effects of a monoclonal antibody treatment called bamlanivimab, made by Eli Lilly and Co, but is vulnerable to the protection offered by other monoclonal antibody treatments., A French study published in Nature Thursday showed the Delta variant was four times less sensitive than the Alpha variant to blood collected from people who had recovered from Covid-19 up to 12 months ago. , The same researchers found a single dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines was not effective against either the Beta or Delta variants. Antibodies in blood from just 10% of people in the study neutralized the Delta variant after a single vaccine dose. But a second dose of vaccine elicited an immune response in 95% of people in the study, though antibodies were significantly less potent against the Delta variant compared to the Beta variant., , \"Early data from Scotland, from individuals who tested positive from 1 April to 21 June 2021, showed an increased risk of hospitalization among cases infected with the Delta variant compared with those infected with the Alpha variant,\" WHO noted., Delta carries a distinct cluster of mutations compared to other variants, including one called L452R known to increase transmissibility. It does not carry two other worrying mutations known as E484K and N501Y -- which are seen in the B.1.1.7 or Alpha variant first seen in Britain, which swept many countries at the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and also in the B.1.351 variant of Beta variant first seen in South Africa, and well as the P.1 or Gamma variant., Alpha, This past spring, it was the B.1.1.7 or Alpha variant of coronavirus that was worrying public health officials. It swept across England quickly and then out into the world, quickly becoming the dominant lineage in the US., As of Sunday, it accounted for just 28.7% of cases in the US, the CDC estimates, as it was replaced by Delta., It was shown to be at least 50% more transmissible than older lineages. It carries 23 mutations, including one called N501Y that increases transmission., It\'s fully susceptible to monoclonal antibody treatments and vaccines., Beta, First seen in South Africa, the B.1.351 or Beta variant has both the E484K mutation that is linked with immune escape and the N501Y mutation suspected of helping make many other variants more contagious. It has been shown to be 50% more transmissible than older strains and evades Lilly\'s dual monoclonal antibody treatment but not others. , Blood tests and real-life use both suggest it can infect people who have recovered from coronavirus and also people who have been vaccinated against Covid-19., , Vaccine makers trying to get out ahead of the new variants by developing booster shots have focused on B.1.351, as it\'s the variant scientists most fear could elude vaccine protection. But partial escape doesn\'t mean full escape, and vaccines are still expected to protect people to some degree., It\'s being overtaken by Delta in South Africa and have never gained much of a foothold in the US, where it currently accounts for 0.2% of new cases, according to CDC., Gamma, The P.1 or Gamma variant that swept Brazil currently accounts for 8.9% of new infections in the US, according to CDC., Gamma carries both the E484K and N501Y mutations, with more than 30 others. It has been demonstrated to evade the effects of Lilly\'s monoclonal antibody treatment but not one made by Regeneron. Blood tests show it might partly escape both natural and vaccine-elicited immune responses., Epsilon, The B.1.427 and B.1.429 variants are usually lumped together and known as Epsilon., First seen in California, this one has the same L452R mutation carried by Delta, but not some of its other mutations and has not taken off in the way Delta has., \"Epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) has been associated with increased transmissibility, a modest decrease in susceptibility to some antibody treatments, and reduced neutralization by convalescent and post-vaccination sera,\" WHO says., , Iota, First seen in New York last November, the B.1.526 or Iota variant accounts for 3% of US cases, CDC estimates. That\'s down from 9% of samples last April., It has what\'s called a 484 mutation that should help the virus attach more easily to the cells it infects and also makes the virus less recognizable to the immune system., Eta, First seen in the UK and Nigeria, Eta, also known as B.1.525, carries the E484K mutation. It\'s decreasing in frequency in the US, now accounting for almost no samples tested., , Zeta , Circulating in Brazil since last year, this variant, also known as P.2, also carries the worrying E484K mutation and has not been found widely globally.

In May -- when the Alpha variant dominated in Israel and the Delta strain had not yet spread widely -- it found that the shot was 95.3% effective against all infections., The government added that the vaccine was now 93% effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalizations, compared to 97% reported in the medical journal The Lancet in May., Israel didn\'t release the data used in its analysis. , Israel is one of the most vaccinated countries in the world, with more than 60% of the population fully inoculated and two-thirds having received at least one dose., A team at Hebrew University said in a separate statement that it was too soon to tell how much the Delta variant was affecting vaccine efficacy., Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University\'s School of Public Health, was also cautious about drawing conclusions. , \"Best data still suggest mRNA vaccines offer high degree of protection against infection and superb protection against severe illness.

If you\'re vaccinated, I wouldn\'t worry,\" he tweeted., Unvaccinated young adults help fuel the spread, If there is another Covid-19 surge, unvaccinated young adults could be a big part of the problem, said Dr. Megan Ranney, associate professor of emergency medicine at Brown University., \"We\'ve already seen that the highest number of infections over the past few months have been in those younger adults,\" said Ranney, who\'s also an emergency physician and director of the Brown-Lifespan Center for Digital Health. , \"These are the people that thought they were invincible.\", West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said he\'s encouraging parents and grandparents of those ages 12-35 to push them to get vaccinated.  , \"The young people out there are the ones that are dragging their feet. The sun is shining, they\'re out of school, all is good in the world and everything, yet they don\'t really realize that they could be the transmitters that could be passing this on to someone that\'s going to die,\" he said during a Tuesday briefing. , As concerns of the delta variant increase, Justice said, \"if you\'re not vaccinated, you\'re part of the problem rather than part of the solution, that\'s all there is to it.\" , As of Tuesday, only 47.5% of Americans have been fully vaccinated, according to CDC data. , More than 11,000 new Covid-19 cases have been reported every day over the past week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. About 200 Americans are dying from Covid-19 every day., Much of the suffering is unnecessary and preventable with vaccines, emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen said. , \"We have the ability to stop Covid in its tracks,\" she said.  , On the other hand, all 50 states have fully vaccinated more than 60% of seniors, CDC data shows, from about 62% in Utah to 94% in Vermont., Missouri hospital transfers Covid-19 patients to other facilities , In Missouri, one hospital has been under such strain that Covid-19 patients are being transferred to hospitals in different health systems., CoxHealth had 94 patients hospitalized for Covid-19 as of Monday, said Kaitlyn McConnell, a CoxHealth public relations director., At Cox South, a hospital in Springfield, 12 Covid-19 patients were transferred to other facilities in the region between Friday and Monday morning. , \"While we have ample supplies and space to care for additional patients, staffing remains a challenge,\" McConnell said. \"Divert is not a permanent status; we only use it temporarily, it is tied to capacity at a particular moment in time and based on what is best for staff and patients.\", The health system had about 170 Covid-19 patients last winter and 280 traveling staff members to help with the response, McConnell said. , Now the system is struggling to meet the current demand -- without the extra help., \"We are aggressively working to have more travelers return -- and hire more staff, as we have throughout the pandemic -- but it is currently a challenge due to times of year that travelers tend to be available,\" said McConnell., In recent weeks, CoxHealth has transferred patients to facilities in Kansas City, St. Louis and out of state to Arkansas. , But now Arkansas is starting to feel the effects of low vaccination rates -- and if worsening trends continue, it could spell another surge, said Dr. Cam Patterson, chancellor of University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences., \"Arkansas, which has a very low vaccination rate, has seen over a hundred percent rise in daily cases over the last two weeks,\" CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner said., As of Sunday, Arkansas\' average rate or new Covid-19 cases was about five times higher than the national average, according to Johns Hopkins data. It\'s also one of the least vaccinated states in the country. , What could this mean for a return to school?, Children who are unvaccinated are still at high risk for infection, Wen said., She said she disagreed with governors such as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has banned public schools from requiring face masks. , \"These governors that have said that schools no longer need masks indoors, that\'s a big mistake,\" Wen said., Considering mental health concerns and educational outcomes, Wen said she thinks it\'s best to have kids back to school -- full time and in-person this fall. , But even mild cases of the Covid-19 can have long-term impacts for children, so safety precautions shouls be taken, she said. , Even vaccinated parents of unvaccinated children may want to wear masks indoors, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases., Because vaccines are highly effective but not perfect, he said it\'s possible adults could get breakthrough infections and pass them to their children., \"We haven\'t formally proven yet how much diminution there is in the likelihood of transmitting it to someone else -- including children -- and that\'s one of the reasons why you\'ve got to be careful when you\'re dealing with something like the Delta variant,\" he said., The best protection against variants, health experts say, is to get vaccinated as soon as possible.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/06/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html',1,163),(126,'Coronavirus almost certainly came from an animal, not a lab leak, top scientists argue','The coronavirus pandemic almost certainly originated from an animal, probably at a wildlife market in China, and not from a laboratory leak, a group of virus experts said Wednesday.Theories about a lab leak are almost all based on coincidence, not hard evidence, the group of 20 top experts from the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere said., They had been following discussions -- going all the way to the White House -- about the possibility of a laboratory origin of the virus, and worked together to analyze the evidence. , \"I think you can make a pretty strong argument that it didn\'t leak from a lab,\" Robert Garry, professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane Medical School and one of the scientists who signed the paper, told CNN., The experts lay out the published evidence in a pre-print review posted online.,  , , It is signed by some of the leading experts in coronaviruses and the genetics of viruses, including Kristian Andersen of The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California; evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey of the University of Arizona; Andrew Rambaut of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Edinburgh; Stephen Goldstein of the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Utah; Angela Rasmussen of the University of Saskatchewan; Joel Wertheim of the University of California, San Diego; and Jeremy Farrar of Britain\'s Wellcome Trust., Many have done their own investigations into the possible origin of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus., \"We contend that there is substantial body of scientific evidence supporting a zoonotic (animal) origin for SARS-CoV-2,\" they wrote. , \"There is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has a laboratory origin. There is no evidence that any early cases had any connection to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), in contrast to the clear epidemiological links to animal markets in Wuhan, nor evidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology possessed or worked on a progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 prior to the pandemic,\" they added.,  , \"The suspicion that SARS-CoV-2 might have a laboratory origin stems from the coincidence that it was first detected in a city that houses a major virological laboratory that studies coronaviruses.\", But it\'s not a surprise that a new virus might emerge in Wuhan, they noted., \"Wuhan is the largest city in central China with multiple animal markets and is a major hub for travel and commerce, well connected to other areas both within China and internationally,\" they wrote., ,  , \"The link to Wuhan therefore more likely reflects the fact that pathogens often require heavily populated areas to become established.\", Garry and colleagues also say it is \"extremely unlikely\" that the lab was working on a virus of natural origin that accidentally leaked out. \"You have to have an unlikely set of circumstances in place for something like that to happen. If it was a person at the lab, then how did it get to all the animal markets?\" Garry asked. \"There are other, much more likely ways that this virus got into the human population. Just like SARS 1, it happened the same way with SARS 2.\",  , What did get lost was some of the valuable evidence that disappeared when the animal markets in the area were cleared and sanitized, Garry said. \"They shut down farms. They cleaned those animals out of that market,\" he said. Samples from the Huanan Seafood Market and others did turn up evidence of the virus, the experts said, but the animals that might have been infected and that could have provided the needed smoking gun were removed., \"We\'d like to know more. We wish the Chinese government was a little bit more open about the wildlife trade,\" Garry said., The World Health Organization has been leading efforts to find the origins of the coronavirus and issued a report in March saying it was most likely the virus originated in an animal and passed to people, as other coronaviruses have. Least likely, it said, is the possibility that a virus was engineered in a lab and leaked out., Much of the investigation has focused on early cases at Wuhan\'s Huanan Seafood market., But WHO has been criticized for accepting evidence from China, and the administration of President Joe Biden has been taking another look at the origins., It\'s not the first joint letter from scientists fed up with speculation. On Monday, in another letter to the Lancet, a group of scientists called for reason and science in the investigation., \"Careful and transparent collection of scientific information is essential to understand how the virus has spread and to develop strategies to mitigate the ongoing impact of COVID-19, whether it occurred wholly within nature or might somehow have reached the community via an alternative route, and prevent future pandemics,\" they wrote., \"Allegations and conjecture are of no help, as they do not facilitate access to information and objective assessment of the pathway from a bat virus to a human pathogen that might help to prevent a future pandemic.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/07/health/origins-coronavirus-letter-virologists-scn/index.html',1,167),(127,'About 160 Covid-19 infections are linked to a Texas church youth camp -- including cases of the Delta variant ','A Covid-19 outbreak stemming from a Texas church summer camp has grown to about 160 cases, including infections of More than 450 people attended the camp for sixth through 12th graders in late June, hosted by Clear Creek Community Church. The camp took place at Tejas Camp &amp; Retreat in Giddings, Texas. , Of the roughly 160 people infected, six (about 3.7%) had been vaccinated, said Dr. Philip Keiser, the Galveston County local health authority. , Samples from some of the infections are being tested to see whether they were caused by the Delta strain -- which is now the dominant variant in the US, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So far, at least three have been confirmed to be the Delta variant, and more are being tested, Keiser said. , The Delta variant has a cluster of mutations, including one known as L452R, that helps it infect human cells more easily.

In May -- when the Alpha variant dominated in Israel and the Delta strain had not yet spread widely -- it found that the shot was 95.3% effective against all infections., The government added that the vaccine was now 93% effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalizations, compared to 97% reported in the medical journal The Lancet in May. , The statement cited top line figures, but did not release underlying data or other details about its analysis. A team at Hebrew University said in a separate statement that it was too soon to tell how much the Delta variant was affecting vaccine efficacy., In another statement Tuesday, Israel\'s Ministry of Health released some data about illness caused by Covid-19 and offered an expanded explanation of the vaccine\'s protectiveness. Despite an apparent decline in the vaccine\'s ability to prevent all infections during the spread of the Delta variant, the statement emphasized its continuing benefit in preventing severe cases., Israel has deployed the Pfizer vaccine to everyone over the age of 12, and its early and quick rollout gave scientists one of the first real-world snapshots of its efficacy., The government said the drop in efficacy is likely due to the spread of the Delta variant in Israel. This more infectious strain of the virus was first identified in India earlier this year and is also known as B.1.617.2., Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN more granular data was needed to determine the exact reason for the drop in efficacy in Israel. While \"the Israelis know what they\'re doing,\" the data is sparse, Fauci said, adding that the circumstances of the reported drop in efficacy are unclear. , Still, Dr. Richard Besser, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CNN the data from Israel is worth paying attention to, because Israel started vaccinating before the US and so \"if there\'s going to be a problem, we\'ll likely see it there before we see it here in the United States.\", \"I take this as actually encouraging information, that these vaccines are still highle effective in terms of preventing hospitalizations, severe illness and death,\" Besser said. , Pfizer said it could not comment on unpublished data, but a recently published lab study it conducted with the University of Texas Medical Branch that found its vaccine was effective against lab-made versions of the Delta strain and others. The study found that full vaccination elicits an immune response that should be expected to protect people well against infection with the new variants., Israel is one of the most vaccinated countries in the world, with more than 60% of the population fully inoculated and two-thirds having received at least one dose. , The statement highlights a big risk going forward: the emergence of new variants that might evade some of the protection provided by vaccines., Public health officials are stressing that the current shots offer good protection against the Delta variant., A study by Public Health England found this month that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines were each highly effective -- at 96% and 92% respectively -- against hospitalizations from the Delta variant after two doses. , Separately, preliminary findings of a Scottish study published in The Lancet last month found that the Pfizer vaccine provided 79% protection against all infections from the Delta variant, compared with 92% against the Alpha variant. The same study, which analyzed data from 5.4 million people in Scotland found the the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine offered 60% protection against infection with the Delta variant compared with 73% for the Alpha variant. , Moderna\'s vaccine was found in lab experiments to work against new variants such as the Delta strain, the company said., Johnson &amp; Johnson said lab tests of its one-shot coronavirus vaccine suggest it provides protection against the Delta variant., Besser said the protection against severe illness is what matters the most. \"While it would be terrific if they prevented all infection, as long as we\'re not seeing a signal that they\'re losing effectiveness for hospitalizations and deaths, that can give us encouragement that if we can increase vaccination in this country, we\'re not going to see the increase in the severity, we\'re not going to see the increase in the deaths with a strain that spreads so much easier,\" he said., However, this can change if the virus mutates further. That\'s why doctors and public health officials want more people to get vaccinated. \"The more we allow the virus to spread, the more opportunity the virus has to change,\" the World Health Organization (WHO) advised last month., Israel lifted most of its coronavirus restrictions in early June. However, the government then reinstated an indoors mask mandate after a spike in cases caused by the Delta variant. It also appointed a \"special manager\" to prevent the entry of the coronavirus and its variants into Israel and approved a plan to build a permanent testing facility at Ben Gurion Airport., The country has reported a slight increase in daily cases in the past few weeks, but only a handful of people have died of the disease in Israel in the past month., Meanwhile, England, where the Delta variant has become the dominant strain, is pushing ahead with its plan to drop most of its remaining restrictions in just two weeks\' time -- despite strong warnings from many scientists. , , Speaking at a government news briefing on Monday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the effectiveness of the vaccine against death was allowing the government to unlock further, even though the number of cases is rising rapidly. He said the government needed to balance the risk from the virus and the impact of the restrictions on people and added the country \"must find a new way of living with the virus.\", \"I want to stress form the outset that this pandemic is far from over ... we\'re seeing cases rise fairly rapidly. There could be 50,000 cases detected per day by the 19th [of July] and again as we predicted we\'re seeing rising hospital admissions, and we must reconcile ourselves sadly to more deaths form Covid,\" Johnson added., The WHO has warned against this approach. \"Many countries seem to be completely abandoning the idea that we have some control over this virus,\" Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO\'s executive director for health emergencies, said during a live Q&amp;A session Monday. He warned against any \"premature rush\" to reopen at a time when cases are on the rise., \"We seem to be very much caught in the headlines that there is nothing we can do, it\'s inevitable that we will going to see these waves and it\'s inevitable that hospitals will fill up and inevitable that the graveyards are going to fill up,\" he said. \"It\'s not inevitable, it can be stopped, but it\'s going to take yet another effort from communities that are exhausted.\", A previous version of this story incorrectly quoted Boris Johnson as saying cases in England might rise when the restrictions lift on June 19.

They\'re also a risk to everyone if they become infected with coronavirus, infectious disease specialists say.That\'s because the only source of new coronavirus variants is the body of an infected person., \"Unvaccinated people are potential variant factories,\" Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told CNN Friday., \"The more unvaccinated people there are, the more opportunities for the virus to multiply,\" Schaffner said., \"When it does, it mutates, and it could throw off a variant mutation that is even more serious down the road.\", All viruses mutate, and while the coronavirus is not particularly mutation-prone, it does change and evolve., Most of the changes mean nothing to the virus, and some can weaken it. But sometimes, a virus develops a random mutation that gives it an advantage -- better transmissibility, for instance, or more efficient replication, or an ability to infect a great diversity of hosts., Viruses with an advantage will outcompete other viruses, and will eventually make up the majority of virus particles infecting someone. If that infected person passes the virus to someone else, they\'ll be passing along the mutant version., If a mutant version is successful enough, it becomes a variant., But it has to replicate to do that. An unvaccinated person provides that opportunity., \"As mutations come up in viruses, the ones that persist are the ones that make it easier for the virus to spread in the population,\" Andrew Pekosz, a microbiologist and immunologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told CNN., \"Every time the viruses changes, that gives the virus a different platform to add more mutations. Now we have viruses that spread more efficiently.\", Viruses that don\'t spread cannot mutate., Variants have arisen all over the world -- the B.1.1.7 or Alpha variant was first seen in England. The B.1.351 or Beta variant was first spotted in South Africa. The Delta variant, also called B.1.617.2, was seen first in India. And the US has thrown up several of its own variants, including the B.1.427 or Epsilon lineage first seen in California, and the B.1.526 or Eta variant first seen in New York., Already, one new variant has swept much of the world. Last summer, a version of the virus carrying a mutation called D614G went from Europe to the US and then the rest of the world. The change made the virus more successful -- it replicated better -- so that version took over from the original strain that emerged from China. It appeared before people starting naming the variants, but it became the default version of the virus., Most of the newer variants added changes to D614G. The Alpha variant, or B.1.1.7, became the dominant variant in the US by late spring thanks to its extra transmissibility. Now the Delta variant is even more transmissible, and it\'s set to become the dominant variant in many countries, including the US., The current vaccines protect well against all the variants so far, but that could change at any moment. That\'s why doctors and public health officials want more people to get vaccinated., \"The more we allow the virus to spread, the more opportunity the virus has to change,\" the World Health Organization advised last month., Vaccines are not widely available in many countries. But in the US, there is plenty of supply, with slowing demand. Just 18 states have fully vaccinated more than half their residents, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., \"Currently, approximately 1,000 counties in the United States have vaccination coverage of less than 30%. These communities, primarily in the Southeast and Midwest, are our most vulnerable. In some of these areas, we are already seeing increasing rates of disease,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told a White House briefing Thursday., \"Every time we see the virus circulating in the population, particularly a population that has pockets of immune people, vaccinated people, and pockets of unvaccinated people, you have a situation where the virus can probe,\" Pekosz said., If a virus tries to infect someone with immunity, it may fail, or it may succeed and cause a mild or asymptomatic infection. In that case, it will replicate in response to the pressure from a primed immune system., Like a bank robber whose picture is on wanted posters everywhere, the virus that succeeds will be the virus that makes a random change that makes it look less visible to the immune system., Those populations of unvaccinated people give the virus the change not only to spread, but to change., \"All it takes is one mutation in one person,\" said Dr. Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician and immunologist at Boston College.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/03/health/unvaccinated-variant-factories/index.html',1,178),(133,'Tyson recalls 8.5 million pounds of chicken products due to possible listeria contamination','Tyson Foods Inc. is recalling nearly 8.5 million pounds of ready-to-eat chicken products because they may be contaminated with Listeria, the \"The frozen, fully cooked chicken products were produced between December 26, 2020 and April 13, 2021,\" the agency said in a statement., \"The products subject to recall bear establishment number \'EST.

But he has never worked as hard to generate new therapies and save lives as he has during the Covid-19 crisis.\"Desperation or urgency can push us away from the scientific method,\" said Cohen, now a distinguished professor of medicine, microbiology, and epidemiology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. \"It is better to not throw stuff against the wall.\", But that\'s just what happened during the pandemic, as doctors desperate to save patients any way they could as they filled hospital beds, intensive care units and emergency rooms., Cohen and other experts say it\'s time to return to what works., , , Cohen needed to trade on all of his experience after he was called to help lead the Covid-19 Prevention Trials Network, part of the Operation Warp Speed initiative during the Trump administration, and which has continued under the Biden administration\'s Covid-19 response team but without the same name., In the role, he directed studies of Covid-19 monoclonal antibodies, building off existing clinical trial networks for HIV/AIDS. Over the past few decades, the FDA had approved monoclonal antibody therapies for conditions including cancers and autoimmune diseases, as well as HIV in 2018., The treatment—which he helped pioneer in HIV—involves finding or engineering the most effective antibodies to fight a specific pathogen and infusing them into patients., If given early in the disease course, monoclonal antibodies can dramatically reduce hospitalizations and save lives. ,  , , \"All our investments in HIV all paid off with everything we did in Covid,\" Cohen said. \"To my knowledge, the only drugs that have blunted the progression of disease are monoclonal antibodies.\", Even some of those have failed, however, as the virus evolves into forms that can evade the effects of highly focused antibodies. Scientists agree treatments that specifically attack the coronavirus -- antivirals -- are vital. To that end, the health and Human Services Department announced a $3.2 billion plan last month to accelerate development of antivirals., Doctors who specialize in testing new drugs hope the US scientific establishment will do better this time.,  , Conduct bigger trials coordinated across institutions,  , In normal times when science isn\'t racing against the clock to defeat a pandemic, the process to introduce a new therapy into health care typically begins with first testing drugs in animals, then in humans, and then in clinical trials. This process can take a decade—and often much longer. , When a drug does perform well enough to make it to be tested on humans, that process is also painstakingly slow. Clinical trials have three phases, with the first being focused on safety alone. The second phase is designed to study if the drug works in a small group of patients. These trials typically involve a few hundred participants and range from a few months up to two years. They are vital for refining research questions and sharpening research protocols, according to the FDA. , Finally, the most promising drugs enter a Phase 3 trial, which involves hundreds or thousands of patients. These longer trials usually last one to four years and can be particularly important in identifying rare or long-term side effects.  , If the drug\'s benefits outweigh its risks, then a company can send a new drug application seeking approval by the US Food and Drug Administration.,  , Phase 3 randomized control trials, in which a group of people receive an experimental drug and are compared with another group receiving a placebo, are considered the gold standard for clinical research., As the Covid-19 death toll mounted, however, that slow, methodical process at the core of quality science butted up against the demands of a global health emergency., \"You have to be fair to how people felt trying to save dying people or seeing someone they thought was going to do terribly and trying to prevent progression of disease,\" Cohen said. \"Physicians try to do the best they can under adverse circumstances.\", But many of the quick clinical trials designed at the height of the crisis didn\'t add much value, said Dr. David Fajgenbaum, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.,  , , He led a team that has reviewed all Covid-19 clinical trial data, more than 29,000 papers on 590 treatments so far, and one of their frustrations was the data they were reviewing could be scattershot: Comparing various clinical trials could be like apples and oranges, with some studies aiming to reduce mortality, and others seeking to prevent emergency room visits or reduce symptoms., Many drug trials were too small, testing dozens of volunteers rather than thousands, and there was no command-and-control structure to direct multiple institutions to study the same drug in the same way at the same time, so as to create data that did have statistical significance., Pick the right drugs for big trials , Progress stalled because individual institutions ran smaller studies on hundreds of different compounds rather than having one entity organizing the nation\'s scientists to focus on the one or two dozen most promising repurposed drugs, said Fajgenbaum., Few drug trials for Covid-19 had shown significant efficacy, Fajgenbaum explained, partly because the vast majority of patients get better on their own. That\'s different from a virus such as Ebola, which can have a death rate without treatment of up to 90%., \"If it\'s a disease where no one gets better without therapy, you don\'t really need that big of a trial,\" he said. \"If a small number of people in your small trial get better with therapy, then you know that the drug worked. But for a disease when most people get better without therapy, then you really need a big trial and ideally you have multicenter trials.\",  , , While Operation Warp Speed had focused on developing vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, Fajgenbaum lamented that there wasn\'t a similarly coordinated public-private partnership to identify which repurposed drugs showed promise to be tried in large clinical trials., Better trial organization could have turned up more opportunities to repurpose other existing drugs against the virus. However, experts did cite two examples of large-scale trials internationally that did produce significant results., The United Kingdom\'s Recovery trial studied more than 40,000 participants at 181 sites. One of its key insights by mid-June last year was data from more than 2,000 patients that showed the cheap steroid dexamethasone could reduce mortality in hospitalized patients by up to one-third.,  , , The Solidarity trial, run by the World Health Organization, enrolled 12,000 patients across 500 locations, and published its interim results in October 2020. Through it could boast of a robust multicenter design, the four treatments it studied -- the antiviral remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, the HIV drug combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, and an immune modulating drug called interferon -- showed little to no effect on reducing overall mortality, ventilation or the duration of a patient\'s hospital stay., Now that the world\'s basic scientific understanding of how Covid-19 works has dramatically improved, that same trial structure can now be adapted to a different class of therapies, which could prove efficacious this time, some of the experts who spoke to CNN suggested. Solidarity is relaunching this year to look at three immune modulation drugs, which may be able to help tamp down the immune system overreaction that can worsen Covid-19., A large-scale US National Institutes of Health effort to systematically identify therapeutics to help non-hospitalized patients, the ACTIV-6 trial, will enroll as many as 13,500 participants to test seven drugs. , ,  , \"The planning for it didn\'t start until this calendar year,\" said Fajgenbaum, who served on the FDA committee to short list with drugs would be tried., The full ACTIV-6 roster isn\'t announced yet, but one therapy on the list so far is the cheap anti-parasite drug ivermectin, which has been used globally to address river blindness., Fajgenbaum hopes for a more systematic approach in this one. \"What drugs are coming out of the literature that look promising, and who should do a study and how big should it be? That just doesn\'t happen. It\'s purely random chance,\" he said., Find better ways to share data,  , Even short of a national public-private partnership to discover which drugs work, there are other ways to get scientists on the same page to be able to deliver better results, according to Dr. Harlan Krumholz, professor of cardiology at Yale School of Medicine., In late April, he and colleagues published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine noting that the National Institutes of Health had spent roughly $2 billion on Covid-19 research, including for diagnostics and vaccines. However, 92% of drug trials for Covid-19 weren\'t completed or did not release their data., They argued that open-science principles -- such as standard processes for sharing protocols and registering studies, reporting and disseminating results, as well as sharing data and biospecimens -- were key to improving outcomes. These practices \"could have benefits beyond the pandemic,\" they wrote., , , They called on the federal government to make adhering to those standards a condition for receiving public funding, a reform that could help maximize the return on investment from tax dollars., \"For many of the questions that would have benefited from large, rapid, simple studies, we were just unable to execute,\" said Krumholz, who is also director of Yale\'s Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation., \"A lot of the studies ended up being underpowered. Lots were not reported. And there were a wide variety of definitions that were used, so that there was no master study protocol that encouraged people to be using similar definitions so that studies and experiences can be easily combined,\" he added., While the US bet big on monoclonals and reopening society hinged on the race to the vaccine, lives could have been saved in the interim in knowing which drugs to administer, Krumholz argued.,  , \"These master study protocols, the development of targets, doing it across the country, answering questions as quickly as possible -- I mean, that should have been part of the race,\" he said. \"But again, there was no national strategy for that.\", \"I think what went right with the vaccines could be a lesson to what we could and should have done with trials on diagnostics and therapeutics. We shouldn\'t have limited it to the vaccine. There was plenty more to be racing toward,\" he said. \"You could have done an Operation Warp Speed for diagnostics and therapeutics.\", Make collaboration, rather than competition, the goal,  , In June 2019, Krumholz co-founded the preprint server medRxiv, a venue on which researchers could post their research studies and articles prior to undergoing what is often a lengthy peer review process. The pandemic accelerated its use, giving the world free access to the latest science., \"People all around the world have used this to post studies, some of them good and some of them not, but (preprint servers) enable rapid scientific communication, and then critique and discussion,\" he said. \"Sometimes people are communicating by Twitter and sometimes by press conference in the midst of a rapid pandemic, but this allowed people to have a more substantive case for people to evaluate.\", Enlist citizens and engage patients,  , Krumholz and colleagues also argued for releasing participant-level data from studies, writing that the transparency could help \"bolster the evidence base for treating Covid-19\" and give more buy-in to patients who took the risk of enrolling in the trial., Designing patient-centered trials could be particularly helpful in treating \"long Covid,\" in which patients can experience months of symptoms such as fatigue and brain fog following an initial infection, can affect an estimated 10% of those infected, Krumholz said. , Investigating the reasons for these ongoing symptoms, and how to treat them, is a crucial next phase in fully understanding the virus. And the quest illustrates principles about how patients themselves can actually be the scientists, according to Susannah Fox, former chief technology officer for HHS, and author of an upcoming book on peer-to-peer healthcare.,  , , She highlighted how the support group Body Politic built out its Patient-Led Research Collaborative which gathered data from 3,762 respondents on how Covid-19 had affected them over a seven-month period. The study -- generated by patient experts rather than researchers cloistered in a lab -- alerted officials to the severity and longevity of symptoms in people who had supposedly recovered, but weren\'t receiving adequate treatments. The preprint study was featured on NIH Director Francis Collins\' blog, and caught the eye of the WHO., \"What I think we can learn from the Body Politic approach is that if you are respectful of the participants, if you allow the people with the condition to design the survey, to design the registry, they will be more likely to participate. They will be more likely to stick with it, and answer your long questionnaires, because it\'s really a question of respect,\" Fox said.,  Meet participants where they are -- even if that\'s at home, As schools shifted to online classes and workplaces opted for telework during the pandemic, scientists conducting clinical trials for drugs had to embrace similar tactics to keep studies going., Lockdowns and physical distancing caused disruptions around the idea of good clinical practice, according to Michael Kurilla, director of clinical innovation at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, part of the National Institutes of Health., \"Covid in particular has provided us with a good opportunity to not only understand but to exercise a whole category of remote research,\" he said. \"There were a lot of innovative approaches that were developed in order to make these trials work and I think that is something that will go forward.\", Kurilla has been working the research community to determine which new approaches can be applied to situations when there is not a pandemic.,  , Those could include having nurses or other health professionals make home visits rather than require sick patients to return to the hospital, enabling patients to report symptoms and data via smartphone apps, and new ways of shipping devices to participants to prick their fingers and send blood samples to researchers through the mail., And while most research takes place in major medical centers, the bulk of Covid-19 patients are treated in community hospitals. That means building stronger relationships between the NIH smaller regional hospitals as well as equipping them with the technical expertise and assistance so that they can stand up all the necessary resources to undertake a trial, he emphasized., \"One of the hopes is that not only will this better prepare us for the next pandemic, but it will actually encourage activity into areas we haven\'t considered very feasible because of lack of infrastructure,\" he said. \"So it\'s really trying to make the entire health care ecosystem a little more responsive to future needs.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/04/health/drug-trials-covid-pandemic/index.html',1,180),(135,'Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Taking America\'s pulse on its birthday ','As many of you who regularly visit CNN.com know, on occasion throughout the pandemic, I have talked about the United States as if  , I was there when the country first developed mild symptoms, and then tested positive for a new mysterious disease. I worried as the disease spread and I watched as the patient progressively worsened, needed ICU care and at times became unstable. Even as the country was eventually transferred to a general care floor and then to recovery, I stayed at its bedside. And, I am still there. ,  , So, on this Fourth of July -- the country\'s second pandemic birthday -- I thought it might be a good time to once again check in on the patient and take the pulse of the country.   ,  , When I looked at America\'s chart on its last birthday, I wrote that the patient was not doing well at all: infection hot spots were cropping up around the country yet the patient hadn\'t been following basic doctors\' orders to wear masks, socially distance and stay home as much as possible. ,  , I was frustrated because I thought I, as a doctor, would be having a different conversation. Instead of celebrating the patient\'s progress, I was worried about the sickness growing within. Even though the patient was getting the best care and best advice from specialists and experts across the land, America was not heeding it; instead, the patient was stopping treatment too soon, reopening too quickly, tossing aside masks and gathering at events both large and small. , , By the time I wrote the next essay in early December the patient was in intensive care, in pure crisis mode with infections and deaths skyrocketing well above the spring 2020 peaks, with the worst still yet to come. ,  , One thing is certain: a lot has changed since this time last year -- but a lot has also remained the same. , How the patient is doing now , The very good news is that the patient now appears fully on the road to recovery, at least physical recovery. (The mental and emotional recovery will probably take a lot longer.) And that\'s almost completely due to vaccines, a Hail Mary pass thrown at the start of the pandemic that was miraculously caught and run into the end zone right before the end of 2020 with the US Food and Drug Administration authorization of the first two candidates. ,  , The vaccines -- and massive vaccination effort surrounding them -- have pushed down infection and deaths rates since the start of 2021. But it\'s important to remember the patient isn\'t entirely healed and back to normal yet, no matter how much it would like to think it is. ,  , As wonderful and effective as the vaccines are, their uptake has slowed greatly, from more than 3 million shots a day at their peak in April to around 1 million a day more recently.,  , Although the country has gotten close, President Joe Biden\'s goal of having 70% of American adults with at least one shot in the arm by July 4 doesn\'t look like it\'s going to be met. We\'re currently at 66.7% -- two thirds -- of Americans adults with at least one dose. (Seventeen individual states have met Biden\'s goal.) ,  , And this slowdown of the vaccination effort is hampering the patient\'s overall recovery effort. Experts warn we could see outbreaks in pockets of the country with the lowest vaccination rates -- such as Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Wyoming, and Louisiana -- each of which has less than 36% of its total population fully vaccinated (compared to more than 47% for the country as a whole).,  , Biden\'s chief medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said earlier this week he\'s \"very concerned\" about the disparity in vaccination rates, which he feels could lead to there soon being \"two Americas\" -- one where most people are vaccinated, and therefore safe, and another where low vaccination rates could lead to case spikes. ,  , Not only that, but pockets of low vaccination rates create the perfect conditions for dangerous variants to arise: They allow the virus to spread and possibly mutate into something more transmissible, or more dangerous, or more resistant to the tools we have against it -- including our vaccines and the medicines we currently have at our disposal to fight Covid-19. ,  , In other words, the patient, who still has an infection, needs to finish taking all of their medicine, even if they\'re feeling better. It\'s like finishing a course of antibiotics: If you don\'t take the full course, the medicine only kills the weakest bacteria -- leaving the strongest to multiply, ultimately creating an antibiotic-resistant infection. In this case, vaccines are the medicine -- and a full course means as many of us as possible need to get all the necessary doses. , Vaccine versus variants , Speaking of variants, there is much concern is over the newer Delta variant, first identified in India, which is more transmissible and may be linked to more serious disease than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus; it is now in all 50 states and Washington DC and is estimated to make up more than 25% of all new infections in the country.  The Delta variant is predominantly infecting unvaccinated individuals, including adolescents and young adults, who now make up about a third of all those hospitalized with Covid-19. , , The situation is being made worse by the fact that young adults are one of the very groups lagging when it comes to vaccinations. ,  , Even though case numbers have declined dramatically since the start of 2021, cases have plateaued and even ticked slightly upward in recent days. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Wednesday the seven-day average climbed to almost 15,000 new cases, from about 12,500 the week before. ,  , \"While this is a 95% decrease, lower from our peak into early January, it does also reflect a 10% increase in the seven-day average from last week,\" CDC head Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Thursday, during a virtual White House briefing. ,  , The question now is: Will we also soon see an uptick in hospitalizations and deaths?  , , The Biden administration is so concerned about the double-whammy of variants and low vaccination rates, it is planning to deploy response teams across the country to areas with a high spread of the Delta variant to offer surge testing, support staff for vaccination sites and medicines such as monoclonal antibodies that have been shown to help people avoid getting very sick.   , Masks make a comeback , As a sign of how troubling the Delta variant is -- Fauci called it the \"greatest threat\" to progress against Covid-19 in the United States -- consider that masks are once again inching onto the stage, both here and abroad., , The World Health Organization, whose mandate is to safeguard global health, never stopped encouraging indoor masking (even among the vaccinated), probably because much of the world remains unvaccinated. But even Israel, a country with very high vaccination rates, returned recently to mandatory indoor masking, specifically to combat the spread of the Delta variant. ,  , In this country, the CDC is so far sticking by its guidance, which it changed back in mid May, stating that fully vaccinated people can choose to not wear masks both indoors and out, in most situations. It was a decision that surprised many of us caring for this patient at the time, as if the CDC were allowing the patient to run before it could fully walk -- especially because it came so quickly and without warning, leaving many people, businesses, organizations unprepared.   , , But the tide is turning in some localities, especially places that are seeing a high number of cases due to the Delta variant, like Los Angeles County, which urged everyone, even those who are vaccinated, to wear masks in public indoor spaces. In Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker this week also encouraged people to wear masks indoors even if they are vaccinated due to spread of Delta variant. And New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said that while the state will not reinstate masks for students in the fall, that could change if things get worse. ,  , Walensky agrees that mask guidance should be flexible. \"We are still seeing uptick in cases in areas of low vaccination, and in that situation we are suggesting that policies be made at the local level. And those masking policies are really intended to protect the unvaccinated,\" she said. \"The vaccinated, we believe, still are safe.\" , Recovery is a rollercoaster ride  , I find it encouraging that local authorities are stepping in and making good sound decisions based on science and what is going on in their communities. It\'s become pretty clear that we\'re never going to be completely rid of SARS-CoV-2: All signs point to it circulating among us for the foreseeable future. , , While we can\'t eradicate it, we can manage it, especially with the tools we have at our disposal right now, like vaccines and even mask-wearing. And until there\'s a vaccine for the entire population, we can protect children and others by getting vaccinated ourselves, wearing masks and keeping them away from big crowds and risky situations. ,  , We have to be flexible and nimble, adapting to all the curve balls that the virus throws our way. But we should never let our guard down, nor should we make unforced errors. , , For the patient, our country, that means recovery may look less like a straight line and more like a roller coaster, with highs followed by dips. , , As a doctor, I want to remind America that it is not 100% healed yet; I strongly urge the country to take it slowly, to finish taking all of its medicine. By that, I mean get vaccinated, get your second shot if you haven\'t already and get your kids vaccinated when they become eligible.  ,  , What\'s heartbreaking to me as a doctor is that throughout the pandemic, my patient didn\'t do very well. And while things are certainly much better, America is still not where it could be. There is a seven-day average of well over 10,000 new infections a day; a portion of those people will need to be hospitalized, and another portion will struggle with long-haul Covid. And we can\'t forget that every single day, an average of more than 250 people are still dying of Covid-19. At this point, almost all these are preventable deaths. , , I am convinced the patient will recover, but now it is just a question of how long it will take and what the human and economic cost will be of letting the infection smolder too long.  , , Going forward the patient must do better; we must do better. Because as I keep on saying, we\'re still all in this together. , ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/03/health/july-fourth-america-patient-covid-gupta/index.html',1,181),(136,'Local officials sound the alarm over another possible wave of Covid-19 infections','Local officials are sounding the alarm over an increase in In Arkansas, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the nation, cases are surging, officials said.

In the same time period, more than 98% of those hospitalized with Covid-19 were not vaccinated., Arkansas has fully vaccinated 34.3% of its total population, federal data shows. , \"The vaccine, as well as continued practicing of social distancing and masking when that is necessary, are our pathways out of a third surge of Covid-19,\" Patterson said., Nationally, the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases has been going up for six straight days, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. As of Thursday, the seven-day moving average of new cases -- just more than 12,700 per day -- was up 9.08% compared to the week prior. , \"Looking state by state and county by county, it is clear that communities where people remain unvaccinated are communities that remain vulnerable,\" Dr. Rochelle Walensky, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Thursday. \"This is all true as we monitor the continued spread of the hyper-transmissible Delta variant.\", Los Angeles reports highest number of new daily cases since April, Los Angeles County, where 59% of residents aged 16 and older are fully vacinated, on Thursday reported 506 new Covid-19 cases, the highest in a single day since mid-April, Health Director Barbara Ferrer said., The threat of another wave can be triggered by the 4 million people who have yet to get vaccinated, she warned.  , \"We have enough risk and enough unvaccinated people for Delta to pose a threat to our recovery and masking up now, could help prevent a resurgence in transmission,\" Ferrer said, pushing back against criticism about guidance to resume mask-wearing indoors., The county is one of the first areas in the US to revisit its mask recommendation after California lifted most of its Covid-19 restrictions last month. The new, voluntary mask guidance is needed until health officials can \"better understand how and to who the Delta variant is spreading,\" the county\'s department of public health said., But just weeks after dropping most restrictions on businesses, the state has a whole as seen cases ticking upward, doubling the state\'s positivity rate, according to data from California\'s Department of Public Health. While still relatively low, the state\'s test positivity rate has increased from 0.7% on June 15 to 1.5% on Friday. , \"The most important thing we can do to stop the spread of COVID-19, and the variants, is ensure everyone who is eligible gets vaccinated,\" Health Officer Tomás Aragón said Friday., Delta variant will make it harder to reach herd immunity, Two-thirds of adults in the US have received at least one dose of the vaccine as of Thursday, CDC data shows. Over the past week, an average of 661,795 people became fully vaccinated daily., But even as vaccinations continue, the Delta variant could make it harder for the US to reach herd immunity, Assistant Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine told CNN Friday. , , \"We don\'t exactly know what the herd immunity percentage would be for Covid-19. It would be different for the Delta variant, and higher, because it is more transmissible,\" Levine told CNN\'s Ana Cabrera., The Delta variant, first seen in India, has now spread to all 50 states, and has accounted for more than 26% of cases as of June 19, according to the CDC\'s calculations. , People who are vaccinated are protected against the variant, Levine added, underscoring the fact that vaccinated individuals are \"extremely unlikely to get sick\" and that it would be \"virtually impossible for them to require hospitalizations.\" , \"For people who are unvaccinated, the Delta variant poses a threat,\" she said. \"So in areas that have low vaccination rates, those communities and counties and states are vulnerable.\", 4th of July celebrations are OK. But first: Be careful and get vaccinated, Dr. Anthony Fauci offered a glimmer of good news ahead of the holiday: Americans can celebrate with the proper precautions, he said. , \"That is, if you were vaccinated, you have a high degree of protection. If you are not, you should wear a mask, and you should think very seriously about getting vaccinated,\" said Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases., Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, echoed Fauci\'s advice., \"It\'s an appropriate time to step back and celebrate the progress we\'ve made,\" Zients said during a briefing., , US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said he was most worried about people who are unvaccinated headed into the holiday weekend. , \"If you are not vaccinated and if you\'re going to be traveling and seeing others from various households, gathering indoors and if you\'re not masked, then there is a significant risk that the virus will continue to spread,\" he told CNN Friday. , The holiday means that more people will be on the move. , In Chicago, Friday is expected to be the busiest day of travel at O\'Hare and Midway International Airports since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the city\'s Department of Aviation. More than 220,000 passengers are expected to pass through O\'Hare and 41,000 passengers at Midway on Friday, the department said in a statement. , Georgia\'s Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is also expected to see its busiest travel surges since the pandemic began, an airport spokesperson told CNN. During the period from Wednesday through Monday, the airport expects over 1.7 million passengers., J&amp;J vaccines protect against variants and don\'t need boosters, data shows, Johnson &amp; Johnson said its one-shot coronavirus vaccine provides immunity that lasts at least eight months, and it appears to provide protection against the Delta variant., \"Current data for the eight months studied so far show that the single-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine generates a strong neutralizing antibody response that does not wane; rather, we observe an improvement over time,\" Dr. Mathai Mammen, head of research and development at J&amp;J\'s Janssen vaccine arm, said in a statement., The company said one dose elicits both a lasting antibody response and generates immune cells called T-cells that can last for that time period. , Further, the company said additional data from its study of the Covid-19 vaccine will be made available in the coming months.,   And for those who received a J&amp;J shot, Fauci said clinical data currently do not show a need to administer booster doses. , Fauci added that the decision to boost may depend on local conditions and could be determined on a local level., \"But you should only be making a formal recommendation based on clinical data,\" Fauci said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/02/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html',1,182),(137,'Spread of the Delta variant may make it even harder to reach herd immunity, expert says','With so many areas in the United States witnessing \"We don\'t exactly know what the herd immunity percentage would be for Covid-19. It would be different for the Delta variant, and higher, because it is more transmissible,\" Dr. Rachel Levine, assistant secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, told CNN\'s Ana Cabrera on Friday. , Herd immunity is the point where a virus can no longer infect people because enough people already have it or are vaccinated against it. , Estimates vary on how much of the population needs to have immunity to reach that goal. Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said herd immunity might be reached if 70-85% of people are immune.  , There is good news, per Levine, who said, \"People who are vaccinated are protected against this Delta variant. And they\'re extremely unlikely to get sick and it\'s virtually impossible for them to require hospitalizations.\", As for those who remain unvaccinated, \"The Delta variant poses a threat,\" Levine said. , Variant accounting for greater percentage of cases in some states, The Delta variant, first seen in India, can infect people more easily and causes even more severe illnesses. , In California, where about half of the state\'s 40 million population is vaccinated, Covid-19 cases are rising, with the Delta variant accounting for 36% of all new cases, according to officials.  , \"The most important thing we can do to stop the spread of COVID-19, and the variants, is ensure everyone who is eligible gets vaccinated,\" said Dr. Tomás Aragón, California\'s public health officer., On Monday, Los Angeles County recommended that people wear masks in indoor public spaces even if vaccinated and, on Friday, the city and county of St. Louis, Missouri, did the same. Both jurisdictions made the recommendations because of the spread of the variant. , \"As we monitor the Delta variant, we are seeing that it\'s spreading fast, and data shows it is more infectious and impacting younger segments of the population,\" said Dr. Fredrick Echols, the acting director of the City of St. Louis Department of Health, in a news release., \"Missouri is in a really bad place right now,\" said Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and CNN medical analyst. She said the state is seeing a \"dramatic rise\" in Covid-19 cases, similar to the rise seeing last summer. , \"You have places in Missouri where only 10%, 15%, 20% of their residents are fully vaccinated. This new Delta (variant) is going to spread like wildfire there,\" she said. \"They have no choice but to put mask mandates in place while they also try to get vaccines in.\", Regarding Los Angeles County\'s mask mandate, Ranney said that \"in the face of this surge in cases, putting an indoor mask mandate back in place is not the worst thing in the world.\" , Such a mandate will send a signal to people that they should wear a mask if they\'re not vaccinated. But the problem is, she noted, that people who aren\'t vaccinated are also least likely to wear a mask. , CNN analyst Dr. Leana Wen told CNN Friday the states with the lowest vaccination rates are seeing an even higher percentage of the Delta variant in new cases. , \"In the five states with the highest rate of Covid-19 spread, the Delta variant is more than 50% of the cases there. Arkansas is 50%. Utah 60%. Missouri is 70%.\" Wen said. \"I think we have to keep in mind, too, the statistics of who is getting ill. By and large, it is unvaccinated people.\" , , Where US states stand in vaccinations, As of Saturday, 47.3% of the total US population was fully vaccinated, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over the past week, an average of 685,472 people became fully vaccinated per day., There are 19 states that have fully vaccinated more than half their residents. They are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington, as well as Washington, DC., Those states plus Illinois have also reached the Biden administration\'s goal to vaccinate 70% of adults with at least one dose by July 4. The entire country is 3% shy of achieving the goal, with 67% of US adults having at least one dose., Experts agree that the best protection against the Delta variant is vaccination. , Two weeks after the second dose, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is 88% effective against symptomatic infections caused by the Delta variant, Fauci said. Those who received only one dose have less protection., Moderna\'s vaccine was found in lab experiments to work against new variants including the Delta strain, the company said this week. Serum samples from people who received two shots of the Moderna vaccine showed neutralizing activity against the variants, Moderna said in a pre-print study that hasn\'t yet been peer-reviewed., Johnson &amp; Johnson said its one-shot coronavirus vaccine provides immunity that lasts at least eight months, and it appears to provide protection against the Delta variant., , Travel guidance from the WHO , Fauci offered a glimmer of good news ahead of the Fourth of July holiday: Americans can celebrate with the proper precautions, he said., \"That is, if you were vaccinated, you have a high degree of protection. If you are not, you should wear a mask, and you should think very seriously about getting vaccinated,\" he said., However, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said he was most worried about people who are unvaccinated headed into the holiday weekend., \"If you are not vaccinated and if you\'re going to be traveling and seeing others from various households, gathering indoors and if you\'re not masked, then there is a significant risk that the virus will continue to spread,\" he told CNN on Friday., , People are traveling in ever-increasing numbers: The Transportation Security Administration said it screened 2.19 million people at airports across the country on Friday. That\'s the highest number since the pandemic started and higher than the same day in 2019, prior to the pandemic. , AAA expects 47.7 million people will travel by road or air between July 1 and 5, a 40% increase compared to the July 4 holiday last year., Meanwhile, the World Health Organization\'s new interim international travel guidance released Friday takes into account vaccination status as well as variants of concern and variants of interest. , The organization recommends that a \" risk-based approach\" should be followed when Covid-19 measures are implemented. , \"This approach should consider the risk posed by travel for the importation and exportation of cases in the context of the evolving epidemiology, including the emergence and circulation of virus variants of concern; the expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out; and lessons learned while responding to the pandemic, including on the early detection and management of cases and the application of public health and social measures,\" WHO said in a statement.  , WHO also pointed out that proof of vaccination should not be required as a condition to enter or leave a country and that national authorities could consider individualized approaches when implementing testing or quarantine as a condition of entry if people have immunity from vaccination or previously confirmed infection.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/03/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html',1,184),(138,'More places are mixing vaccines, but do they need to?','From Germany to the Dominican Republic, government health authorities are recommending the \"mix-and-match\" approach to vaccination in the hope of better protecting people by giving people them two different types of vaccine -- one as a first dose, and another as a second or even a third dose.But does it really protect people better, and is it even necessary? From a scientific point of view, the jury is still out. , Studies are currently underway to better understand the risks and benefits of mixing coronavirus vaccines -- which might ease logistical problems for some global vaccine programs. But more research is needed to see whether mixed vaccine schedules work in the real world. , , On Thursday, Germany issued what appears to be the strongest recommendation anywhere for the mixing of coronavirus vaccines. , The German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) said people who receive a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine \"should get an mRNA vaccine as their second dose, regardless of their age.\", The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus vaccines use mRNA technology, while AstraZeneca\'s vaccine uses a virus called an adenovirus to deliver immune-generating instructions to the body., STIKO said \"current study results\" show the immune response generated after a mixed dose vaccination \"is clearly superior.\", , The Dominican Republic said Thursday it would begin giving medical professionals a third, booster dose of vaccine to counter emerging coronavirus variants and said recipients should receive a different vaccine type from their first two doses. The country has been using three different vaccines: AstraZeneca\'s, China\'s Sinovac vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine., In June, Canada\'s National Advisory Committee on Immunization made a weaker recommendation when it said \"an mRNA vaccine is now preferred as the second dose for individuals who have received a first dose of AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccine.\", The Canadian committee said it was making the recommendation based on \"emerging evidence of a potentially better immune response from this mixed vaccine schedule.\", , Vaccine schedules that mix the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines all induced robust immune responses, although schedules including the Pfizer vaccine were stronger, researchers in the United Kingdom found., In a separate study, people who got mixed doses of coronavirus vaccines -- receiving a different vaccine type as a second dose than the first dose -- appeared to be more likely to experience mild side effects such as fever, chills, fatigue or headache, researchers in the UK reported in May in the Lancet medical journal., But the side effects following mix-and-match vaccinations were short-lived and there were no other safety concerns., \'A research agenda to try and optimize vaccines\', The idea of using one type of vaccine for a first dose and a different type as the second has been explored for quite some time -- even before the coronavirus pandemic, Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, told CNN on Friday. The concept is called heterologous prime-boost vaccination., \"There were studies in the past with bird flu viruses using heterologous prime-boost, and this is part of a research agenda to try and optimize vaccines,\" Adalja said., \"It\'s early in that research to understand where this will all end up several months to years from now in terms of what Covid vaccines will look like in the future. But it\'s important to understand how to make better second-generation vaccines and to use this knowledge to even improve other vaccines for other infectious diseases,\" Adalja added., , It\'s important to understand how immune responses differ to different vaccines, Adalja said. The immune system responds in varying ways to different vaccine technologies., \"This is a very fruitful area of research that\'s important to understand, and it may help to design better vaccine regimens, especially in people that might not necessarily respond as well to the standard regimens -- for example, an immunosuppressed person who\'s had a solid organ transplant,\" he said., One study, published in June in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, suggests that a third dose of coronavirus vaccine could help boost antibody levels among some organ transplant recipients who have not had robust responses to the standard vaccination schedules., Among patients in the study who had no measurable antibodies after receiving two doses of vaccine, one-third saw a rise in antibodies after a third dose -- and among those with low antibody levels after two doses, all of them saw an increase after a third dose. Some were boosted with the same vaccine but many were not. , No need for boosters quite yet, With the more contagious Delta coronavirus variant circulating in the United States, some people worried whether an extra dose of vaccine would be needed to boost those who have been vaccinated -- especially those who received the Johnson &amp; Johnson coronavirus vaccine, which was perceived as potentially being less effective., But newly released data suggest otherwise., , The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine provides immunity that lasts at least eight months, and it appears to provide adequate protection against the worrying Delta variant, the company said in a statement Thursday night. , \"Current data for the eight months studied so far show that the single-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine generates a strong neutralizing antibody response that does not wane; rather, we observe an improvement over time,\" Dr. Mathai Mammen, head of research and development at J&amp;J\'s Janssen vaccine arm, said in a statement. , The company said one dose of the vaccine elicits both a lasting antibody response and generates immune cells called T-cells that last eight months, also., , This suggests boosters are not needed at this time, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN on Friday., \"We should be driven by the science,\" Offit said. \"Right now, the science tells us the two doses of the mRNA vaccine or a single dose of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine would protect you against severe critical disease caused by the Delta variant.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/02/health/mixing-coronavirus-vaccines-explainer-wellness/index.html',1,185),(139,'J&amp;J Covid-19 vaccine lasts at least 8 months, protects against Delta variant, studies find','The Johnson &amp; Johnson coronavirus vaccine provides immunity that lasts at least eight months, and it appears to provide adequate protection against the worrying Delta variant, the company said in a statement Thursday night.\"Current data for the eight months studied so far show that the single-shot Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine generates a strong neutralizing antibody response that does not wane; rather, we observe an improvement over time,\" Dr. Mathai Mammen, head of research and development at J&amp;J\'s Janssen vaccine arm, said in a statement., The company said one dose of the vaccine elicits both a lasting antibody response and generates immune cells called T-cells that last eight months, also.,  , , Dr. Dan Barouch of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School and colleagues tested blood taken from 20 volunteers in an early stage, Phase 1/2 trial of the vaccine., \"These data are promising and reassuring,\" Barouch told CNN. Barouch has submitted his findings to the BioRxiv pre-print server., \"Data showed that T-cell responses -- including CD8+ T-cells that seek out and destroy infected cells -- persisted over the eight-month timeframe examined,\" the company said.,  These are not real-world efficacy data, but antibody and T-cell response usually indicate protection, Barouch said., Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have both said their two-dose vaccines are protective for at least six months and researchers at Washington University in St. Louis reported earlier this week that their studies of vaccinated volunteers indicate protection from the vaccines should last much longer than that-- even for years. They did not test the JandJ vaccine., , Barouch\'s team also tested blood from the vaccinated volunteers against the most worrying variants of the virus, including the Delta or B.1.617.2 variant first seen in India, the B.1.351 or Beta variant first seen in South Africa, and the P.1 or Gamma variant spreading in Brazil., \"We see robust neutralizing antibody coverage of the variant,\" Barouch said. Neutralizing antibodies are the immune system proteins that inactivate a virus before it can replicate., \"A single dose of the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine generated neutralizing antibodies against a range of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, which increased over time, including against the increasingly prevalent and more transmissible Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, the partially neutralization-resistant Beta (B.1.351), the Gamma (P.1) variants and others, including the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Epsilon (B.1.429), Kappa (B.1.617.1) and D614G variants, as well as the original SARS-CoV-2 strain,\" the company said., , , Separately,  a Janssen team in the Netherlands studied blood taken from eight vaccinated volunteers in the company\'s Phase 3 trial and found similar results against the variants., Earlier Thursday, J&amp;J said a second or booster dose of its vaccine would not be necessary., Dr. Anthony Fauci agreed. \"With regard to the idea of boosting, there\'s a lot of talk about that -- but right now I think we still need to remember that in fact, the J&amp;J vaccine is a highly effective vaccine that has been recommended very clearly and has received an emergency use authorization,\" Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a White House briefing Thursday., , However, JandJ, along wit the US National Institutes of Health, is testing to see whether giving people two doses of its vaccine will provide better protection.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/01/health/johnson-vaccine-delta-variant/index.html',1,186),(140,'Many kids are struggling as they come out of pandemic isolation. Experts advise what may help with the transition','I tapped gently on the driver\'s window while my toddler pressed his back to the passenger door inside the car.\"I don\'t want to go!\" he wailed., We were just over a week into day care drop-off, and the excitement of new people and spaces had worn off. A disorienting world of masks and unrecognizable faces was sinking in., For the past 14 months as the pandemic raged, we\'d been isolated at home, extra cautious because of my chronic health issues. My 3-year-old was used to the sameness of the days and the constancy of our unit. And now everything was changing., Long before the Covid-19 vaccine took full effect in the grown-ups, we\'d been weighing the risks of sending him and his 8-year-old sister back to school and how to prepare for an unpredictable transition. , Now here we were and, despite feverish research and counseling support, I was in a day care parking lot, grasping at straws. , We had watched Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, advise the United States on the pandemic. But as Nikki Raymond, CEO of behavioral health and family preservation service provider Georgia HOPE noted, there was no one as visible speaking out about the inevitable mental health fallout -- and what we should do for ourselves and our kids., Surely there were other families now trying to help their kids adjust to the transition to reopening as vaccines became more widely available in the United States. Here\'s what health and education experts said about managing your kids\' mental health while expanding their once limited circles., Can our kids return to in-person learning? , When deciding if your unvaccinated kids should stay at home or go back to school, it\'s easy for parents (who have a choice) to get caught in a loop of second-guessing themselves. , \"Quiet the noise, focus on who you trust and be honest about your comfort levels and family\'s needs,\" said Erica Fener-Sitkoff, clinical psychologist and executive director of Voices for Georgia\'s Children, a children\'s advocacy nonprofit.  , For starters, avoid comparing your options to other families\' options. Lean on trusted sources for decision-making, whether it\'s your kid\'s pediatrician, your own doctors (if you\'re an immunocompromised adult), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the American Academy of Pediatrics, Fener-Sitkoff said. , Next, identify your boundaries. Be honest about what you\'re comfortable with and what you\'re not ready for yet. Write it down, come back to it, and make changes when you need to. Keeping a log will provide a clear reference and help instill confidence in what you decide, Fener-Sitkoff said. , Talk to your kids, Whether you have toddlers, tweens or teenagers, have age-appropriate conversations about the coming changes and how you can tackle them together. , Begin by acknowledging how you have supported each other alongside the deep losses. Talk about the boundaries you previously set to keep the family safe, how they are changing and why. For example, discuss shifting from not interacting with anyone outside the household to going to a camp with Covid safety protocols. , Explain that additional changes will come as we learn more about the virus or as more people get vaccinated — or not — and that you\'ll continue to talk as a family about those changes. And be sure to communicate what you can all still do to stay safe, Fener-Sitkoff said. , Answering your children\'s questions transparently and checking in often about their experiences during the transition are key to helping them feel more secure in the decisions you\'re making, even if peers\' families are doing things differently., Come up with potential scenarios they may face, like being around others who are unmasked indoors if the family rule is to wear masks, and how your kids might respond, Fener-Sitkoff noted. , Also encourage kids to talk to others they feel safe with, whether it\'s a friend, extended family member or support staff at school or camp., Lower expectations for older kids, All kids need time to adjust to a new routine, said Maia Smith, longtime school social worker with Fulton County in Georgia, but parents of teens need to be extra mindful to respond to their struggles with empathy rather than punishment or restrictions., That\'s because parents tend to have higher expectations of older kids. Hit pause on that. Now is the time for grace and keeping the lines of communication open, even if your teen resists, Fener-Sitkoff said., That could look like pulling your teenager out of their room to talk about friendships, feelings and school activities over a meal, Smith said. , When parents are also vulnerable about their own challenges with the transition, it helps kids feel less alone, said Brittney Walters, a licensed clinical social worker and clinical director of school-based mental health at CHRIS 180, a behavioral health and child welfare service organization. (The letters \"CHRIS\" stand for creativity, honor, respect, integrity and safety.), Start with small group activities, Ease kids into social gatherings with one-on-one time with a good friend or a small group of friends, said Cindy Simpson, CHRIS 180\'s chief operating officer. , In my household, we went to the playground and saw a couple of friends from vaccinated families outdoors. A week before my toddler went back to day care, he met his new classmates and teachers during outdoor play at school, so he wasn\'t completely unfamiliar on his first day., Watch out for sensory processing issues. Kids who have had limited contact with others may be overstimulated in big groups or noisy spaces. Keep a pair of headphones on hand, Walters said. , Kids who have spent most of their time at home may have challenges adjusting to environmental temperature shifts, like getting uncomfortably cold in air-conditioned classrooms.  , \"Could it also be nerves? Maybe,\" Walters said. But it doesn\'t take much to be prepared with a pair of mittens indoors, even in the summer., Create routine and rituals, Many younger kids -- like my 3-year-old -- go through separation anxiety during any transition, Fener-Sitkoff noted., You can develop a new routine to reset their sense of stability, security and confidence in their new environment. The more predictable the routine, the more in control they feel., Develop see-you-later and welcome-home rituals, simple ways of saying goodbye and celebrating being back together at day\'s end. A forehead kiss. A high five. And try to connect screen-free every day for at least 30 minutes., When either parent picks up our toddler from day care, we take a small treat and chat about his day while he nibbles away, reveling in the solo attention., Just before I drop my 8-year-old off to spend time with her grandparents, I will kiss her palm, curl her fingers around it, put it to her heart and promise that\'s where I\'ll be if she misses us. We also came up with a safe word she could use with me if she wasn\'t feeling OK and didn\'t know how to express it. It\'s become a catchall word for how we\'re feeling in the moment., \"Kids remember the little things,\" Fener-Sitkoff said. \"They don\'t cost anything, but they are heartfelt.\"       , Leverage your child\'s school community , With more school districts putting mental health supports in place, teachers, principals or school counselors are good entry points to accessible help. , \"It\'s important to communicate concerns you have about your child returning,\" said Smith, the school social worker. \"Teachers want to help and they recognize that this is a difficult time.\", Encourage your school staff to look out for and talk to you about social and emotional gaps they might observe in your child, and ask how teachers are supported in recognizing signs of trauma and how kids will be directed. , For mental health services, local children\'s hospital systems, health insurance member services, Medicaid and the state Children\'s Health Insurance Program can provide available resources. , , Think beyond therapy to activities that foster enrichment and belonging like the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, or ask the school about activities where costs and transportation may be offset by federal or grant funding. , The pandemic is far from over, and while we can\'t fully predict its impact on our kids\' mental health, we can support them and hope that our best efforts are enough.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/02/health/kids-mental-health-transition-wellness/index.html',1,189),(141,'Germany issues world\'s strongest recommendation for mixing Covid-19 vaccines','Germany has issued what appears to be the strongest recommendation anywhere for the mixing ofThe German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) said Thursday that people who receive a first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine \"should get an mRNA vaccine as their second dose, regardless of their age.\" , This makes Germany one of the first countries to strongly recommend that people who have received a first dose of AstraZeneca receive either a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine as their second dose. , , German Chancellor Angela Merkel helped pave the way for mixed vaccine use when she received the Moderna shot in June as her second dose following a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. , STIKO said that \"current study results\" show that the immune response generated after a mixed dose vaccination \"is clearly superior.\", The mRNA vaccines currently approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. , Canada\'s National Advisory Committee on Immunization made a weaker recommendation on June 17 when they said that \"an mRNA vaccine is now preferred as the second dose for individuals who have received a first dose of AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccine.\", \'Better immune response\', The Canadian committee said it was making the recommendation based on \"emerging evidence of a potentially better immune response from this mixed vaccine schedule.\", A study carried out by researchers at the University of Oxford and published June 28 found that \"alternating doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines generate robust immune responses against COVID-19.\", According to a University of Oxford press release, the paper found that \"both \'mixed\' schedules (Pfizer-BioNTech followed by Oxford-AstraZeneca, and Oxford-AstraZeneca followed by Pfizer-BioNTech) induced high concentrations of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG protein when doses were administered four weeks apart.\", The EMA said in a press briefing on Thursday that although they are not \"not in a position to make any definitive recommendation on the use of different Covid-19 vaccines for the two doses\" there is a \"strong scientific rationale\" behind the approach. , , Marco Cavaleri, head of Biological Health Threats and Vaccines Strategy for the EMA, told the briefing that the agency is \"aware of the preliminary results from studies conducted in Spain and Germany\" that \"show that this strategy achieves satisfactory immune response and no safety concerns.\", Also making reference to the recent Oxford data, Cavaleri said the EMA would continue to review the data as it becomes available. , Cavaleri affirmed that although the EMA makes recommendations \"based on all the available evidence on the benefits and risk of a specific vaccine,\" the responsibility for how the vaccination should be administered falls to \"the expert bodies guiding the vaccination campaigns in each member state.\" , Some European countries have previously administered mRNA vaccines as the second dose following a first dose of AstraZeneca on health and safety grounds, rather than for efficacy. , Following concerns about potentially fatal blood clotting incidents, countries such as Germany and Spain recommended that people under the age of 60 who received a first dose of AstraZeneca should a receive a mRNA dose for their second dose. , In making their recommendation on May 21, the Spanish Bioethics Committee said that although they recommended people who had a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine to receive a second dose of an mRNA vaccine, they would prefer people taking a second dose of AstraZeneca over no second dose at all. , New wave fears, Germany\'s updated guidance comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that Europe was risking a new wave in August due to the relaxation of restrictions, the spread of an infectious Covid-19 variant and low vaccination coverage. , \"Last week, the number of cases rose by 10%, driven by increased mixing, travel, gatherings and easing of social restrictions,\" Hans Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe, said Thursday in a statement, as he warned that the Delta variant would be dominant in the region by the end of the summer. , Some 63% of Europeans are waiting for their first jab, he said. yet Europe \"will still be mostly restriction-free, with increasing travels and gatherings\" in August., \"The three conditions for a new wave of excess hospitalizations and deaths before the autumn are therefore in place: new variants, deficit in vaccine uptake, increased social mixing,\" he said. \"There will be a new wave in the WHO European region unless we remain disciplined, and even more so when there are far fewer rules in place to follow -- and unless we all take the vaccine without hesitation when it is our turn.\", Kluge stressed two doses of the vaccine were effective against the Delta variant. \"But the truth is that the average vaccine coverage in the region is 24% only, and more serious, half of our elders and 40% of our health care workers are still unprotected,\" he said. , \"With these figures, nowhere is the pandemic over, and it would be very wrong for anyone -- citizens or policy makers -- to assume that it is,\" he said.

What are the risks to vaccinated people versus those not yet vaccinated? What if you\'re fully vaccinated, but feeling anxious and not quite ready to see so many people? , We asked CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen for her thoughts. Wen is an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She\'s also author of the forthcoming book \"Lifelines: A Doctor\'s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.\" Here\'s her advice. , , , CNN: What kind of gatherings are safe from a Covid-19 perspective, now that the Delta variant is in the United States?, Dr. Leana Wen: This depends on the answer to one key question: Are you vaccinated? For unvaccinated people, the risk of Covid-19 remains high. This is particularly true with the more contagious Delta variant spreading throughout the United States. People who are unvaccinated should really only be with other unvaccinated people in outdoor settings. If there is only one unvaccinated person and everyone else is vaccinated -- for example, if there is an unvaccinated child but all the adults are vaccinated -- that\'s low risk. The risk becomes higher if there are unvaccinated people from multiple households mixing indoors, which I would not recommend. , , For people who are fully vaccinated, unless you are severely immunocompromised, you are well protected from getting Covid-19 -- including against the Delta variant. What you choose to do depends on your tolerance of risk. It\'s safest to get together outdoors; if you\'re indoors, it\'s also safe to be around others whom you trust to be fully vaccinated. What if others are not vaccinated, but you are? The risk to you around unvaccinated people is low, but it\'s not zero. Some people will say that means they feel comfortable going to indoor restaurants or parties indoors, where there are others around them of unknown vaccination status. Others will still avoid these settings for now., CNN: Does size of the gathering matter?, Wen: Yes and no. If you\'re outdoors and there is plenty of space, it doesn\'t matter if there are hundreds or thousands of others around. But if it\'s a small, packed space -- in particular if it\'s indoors with poor ventilation -- that definitely increases risk if you have a lot of people there., , I do think the size of the gathering matters if you\'re concerned about the vaccination status of those attending. Let\'s say you\'re invited to a dinner party indoors, and you\'d only want to go if everyone there is vaccinated. The larger the group, the harder it may be to trust that everyone is vaccinated. That said, there are concerts and shows with tens of thousands of fans that are requiring proof of vaccination. The bottom line is that it\'s not so much the size of the gathering that I\'d worry about, but rather vaccination status of attendees. That\'s unless it\'s outdoors, in which case it should be safe even for unvaccinated people to attend with other unvaccinated people., CNN: There are a lot of vaccinated people who may not feel comfortable with any of this social activity. They are worried about getting Covid-19, however small the risk it might be. What\'s your advice to them?, Wen: First, know that this is normal. People are responding in very different ways to vaccination and the end of Covid-19 restrictions. Some are so eager to resume all aspects of pre-pandemic life. Others need to take more time., Second, think through the social activities that are the highest value to you, compared to the relative risk of that activity. Maybe it doesn\'t matter to you much if you go to an indoor restaurant, but the thought of it is anxiety-provoking. Postpone that activity for now -- there is nothing wrong with dining outdoors, getting takeout or preparing your own meals. On the other hand, maybe what matters most is to resume your bridge nights and see members of your extended family. If everyone attending is vaccinated, be assured that the risk of contracting Covid-19 is extremely low., , Third, once you\'re engaged in the activity, focus on the here and now. Enjoy the event and think about how wonderful it is to be back doing something you love, with people whose company you\'ve missed. It may feel strange initially to be in close proximity with others and to see people without masks. Focusing on the aspects of the activity that you really enjoy will help make the transition easier., Fourth, take it slow. If you weren\'t seeing anyone before, consider starting with an outdoor meal in a backyard or a park with one or two other people, for an hour or two at a time. You could then have the same people, or another small group, over for dinner at your house, for three hours. If you\'re invited to a large party but aren\'t sure if you\'re ready, go to a medium-size gathering. Ease into larger and longer interactions and go easy on yourself if you don\'t quite feel ready yet., Finally, be OK with saying no. Just because you\'re invited to an event doesn\'t mean that you have to go. And just because others are OK taking a greater level of risk doesn\'t mean you have to as well. Everyone has different medical histories and different interpretations of risk for themselves and their families. We also place different values on what activities we most want to bring back. It is important that we do try to move forward and regain what we most enjoyed pre-pandemic -- as we also acknowledge how difficult this could be., , CNN: What if you\'re at an event, but aren\'t ready to do something -- for example, if someone tries to hug or kiss you, but you don\'t feel comfortable yet?, Wen: I think it\'s entirely fine to take a step back and explain that you\'re not quite ready to hug or kiss yet. Not everyone was comfortable with hugging or kissing -- especially people they don\'t know well -- before the pandemic. Emerging from Covid-19 is an opportunity to reset expectations in social interactions., For those who were big huggers pre-pandemic, it might be a good idea to ask others if it\'s OK to give them a hug before going in for one. Just because we are comfortable ourselves with certain activities doesn\'t mean that everyone else is, too. Checking is always good etiquette, as is being tolerant of other people\'s differing space needs., CNN: There may be some people who are still very anxious about social interactions. At what point might someone need professional help for mental health?, , Wen: Mental health was a neglected health need even before the pandemic. Covid-19 has worsened the mental health crisis in this country., This is another opportunity for a reset. Mental health needs to be considered with the same urgency as physical health. People who have preexisting mental health conditions like depression and anxiety could have seen the issues worsen over the course of the pandemic. They need to seek help for these conditions; in the same way as if they had diabetes that wasn\'t attended to, they need to resume routine medical care. Others may have new mental health issues that emerged, and those could manifest as social anxiety, too. , Know that mental health conditions are very common, and that it\'s critical to treat them. Ask your primary care doctor for recommendations for a mental health specialist., CNN: Are there any other things people should keep in mind over Fourth of July weekend when it comes to health and safety?, Wen: We talked a lot about Covid-19 safety, but coronavirus is not the only thing to be careful about over Fourth of July. In addition to preventing other viruses and foodborne illnesses -- including protect against mosquitoes and ticks, and to wash your hands frequently -- make sure that you are considering water safety with children. And please handle fireworks responsibly, legally and safely, too., Taking all this into consideration, it\'s possible to have a terrific -- and safe -- Fourth of July weekend, as Americans move closer to pre-pandemic normal.

If you are not, you should wear a mask, and you should think very seriously about getting vaccinated,\" added Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases., \"So, in so many respects, nothing has really changed. We are celebrating as a country at the same time as we recognize the fact that we\'re in a serious situation for those who have not been vaccinated. And the message is: Get vaccinated.\", Holiday celebrations nonwithstanding, the Delta variant of the coronavirus continues to spread and the nation has seen an increase in its seven-day average of Covid-19 cases, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday., The nation\'s current seven-day average, covering June 23-29, is 12,609 cases per day, a 10% increase from the previous seven-day average of 11,428, covering June 16-22, said director Dr. Rochelle Walensky during a virtual White House briefing. , And while the seven-day average has decreased 95% since January 10, Walensky said the Delta variant remains a serious threat and could cause more Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in unvaccinated communities, especially those in the Southeast and Midwest., \"The Delta variant is predicted to be the second most prevalent variant in the United States, and I expect that in the coming weeks, it will eclipse the Alpha variant,\" Walensky said. , The Alpha variant, also known as B.1.1.7, was first seen in Britain. The Delta variant, known as B.1.617.2, was first seen in India., Across the country, Walensky said, communities with low vaccination coverage remain vulnerable, especially due to the spread of the \"hyper-transmissible Delta variant.\", \"Currently, approximately 1,000 counties in the United States have vaccination coverage of less than 30%. These communities, primarily in the Southeast and Midwest, are our most vulnerable,\" Walensky said., \"In some of these areas, we are already seeing increasing rates of disease. As the Delta variant continues to spread across the country, we expect to see increased transmissions in these communities, unless we can vaccinate more people now.\", Federal teams to deploy in response to Delta variant, As concerns about the Delta variant grow, the Biden administration announced Thursday that it is deploying response teams across the US to areas with high spread of the virus, a White House official told CNN., These teams will go into communities where officials are worried about a potentially deadly combination: low vaccination rates and a significant presence of the highly infectious Delta variant. The teams will be composed of officials from the CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency., These response teams will help to provide more testing, deploy federal personnel to areas that need support staff for vaccinations and provide therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies. , However, officials believe vaccinations are the top way to stop the spread and recognize there could be a limit to their efforts. Most US adults who plan to get vaccinated against Covid-19 have already done so, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report released this week., \"We want to be as clear as possible,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday. \"If you have been vaccinated, the message we\'re conveying is you\'re safe ... if you are not yet vaccinated, you are not safe and protected. That\'s why you should go get vaccinated. It\'s not more complicated than that in some regards.\", Expert says mask guidance needs to be focused, With uneven vaccination rates across the US and the Delta variant now spotted in all 50 states, one health expert says the federal government\'s mask guidance needs to be more focused., \"Part of the problem is that the CDC is trying to use a one-size-fits-all recommendation for the country rather than being a bit more surgical in identifying hot spot areas where transmission is accelerating,\" Dr. Peter Hotez told CNN\'s Jake Tapper on Wednesday., Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, noted people in areas where vaccination rates are low and the virus is more prevalent may not want to do the same activities as people who live in areas where vaccination rates are high and the virus is more contained. , Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Wyoming have the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with less than 35% of their total population fully vaccinated, according to the most recent data from the CDC., Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont have fully vaccinated more than 60% of their total population, the data shows. , The CDC\'s current mask guidance, which says fully vaccinated people do not need to wear a mask indoors or outdoors, needs to be more specific with the Delta variant in mind, Hotez said. , \"I think that\'s what we need from the CDC is to be able to cut it a little finer, come up with ... a force of infection map that combines those two variables: the low vaccination rates, high Delta. Those places are at great risk for lots of transmission, including some vaccinated individuals who will have breakthrough infections.\", Breakthrough infections, while rare, happen when vaccinated people contract Covid-19. A recent CDC study showed that when vaccinated people are infected, they experience milder illness than unvaccinated people., Fauci said Tuesday he doesn\'t expect the CDC to make changes to its mask guidance but warned Americans must take the Delta variant seriously.  , Fauci noted that vaccines make Covid-19 case surges \"entirely avoidable, entirely preventable.\", Experts: Children should mask up, even around fully vaccinated people , Children under 12 are another vulnerable group in the face of Covid-19 variants because federal officials have not cleared them to receive a vaccine., Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics\' Committee on Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Wednesday that children not yet vaccinated should still mask up, even if they\'re around fully vaccinated people., \"The vast majority of new infections are occurring among unvaccinated individuals,\" Maldonado said in an email to CNN. \"For these unvaccinated children, masking, distancing and avoiding large crowds is recommended.\", Hotez echoed Maldonado\'s stance on children wearing masks., \"I would say right now, if your kids are old enough to wear masks, then they should when they\'re indoors, at least until we can get our arms around this Delta variant,\" said Hotez, noting that parents should take their area\'s vaccination rate and variant levels into account., Federal health officials plan to analyze vaccine data for children younger than 12 in the upcoming fall or winter, said Dr. Peter Marks, who heads the US Food and Drug Administration\'s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research., Misinformation, mistrust and misperception , Former US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said Thursday there are three big issues when it comes to vaccine hesitancy in the United States: misinformation, mistrust and a misperception that access is no longer an issue for certain US communities., \"There are three big \'mis-es\' that we have in terms of vaccine hesitancy,\" Adams told CNN\'s Erica Hill on \"New Day.\", \"One is misinformation. Two is mistrust. And the third is a misperception that access still isn\'t an issue for many communities. For Black and Brown communities, for rural communities, access remains a problem.\" , Adams told Hill that \"mistrust is huge, misinformation, unfortunately, is all over the place and we need the federal government, I\'m going to say this today in my testimony, to really have a full-court press on PSAs, on community engagement to combat that constant stream of misinformation.\" , Adams was testifying Thursday at a House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis hearing on vaccine hesitancy., African American communities have \"a good reason for mistrust,\" he said, and Hispanic communities are afraid they will face immigration issues if they come in and get vaccinated. , Many rural communities have been put off by the politicization of the pandemic, Adams said, \"and everyone\'s responsible for that.\" He said he has never heard someone say that they wouldn\'t get vaccinated because they\'re a Republican; rather, they say they don\'t trust the government or medical institutions. , More research shows vaccines work and they\'re highly effective , As of Thursday, 47% of the total US population is fully vaccinated, CDC data showed. In the past seven days, the US averaged 26.6 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people., While still lagging, vaccination coverage among young adults is improving, CDC data shows. Over the past two weeks, the 18-24 age group made up 12.6% of those becoming fully vaccinated, the CDC said., Meanwhile, a new study is highlighting the importance of vaccines and the protection they offer. The study examined nearly 4,000 frontline health and emergency workers shows that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines were 91% effective in preventing infection after two doses and 81% effective after a single dose., \"If you get vaccinated, about 90% of the time you\'re not going to get COVID-19,\" Dr. Jeff Burgess of the University of Arizona, which participated in the study, said in a statement. \"Even if you do get it, there will be less of the virus in you and your illness is likely to be much milder.\", The team, led by CDC epidemiologist Mark Thompson, studied 3,975 health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers. , The virus was detected in 204 participants, of whom five were fully vaccinated, 11 partially vaccinated and 156 unvaccinated, the report in the New England Journal of Medicine said., Those who were vaccinated and got infected anyway had less virus in their bodies -- 40% less, researchers added. Vaccinated people were 58% less likely to have fevers. \"And the duration of illness was shorter, with 2.3 fewer days spent sick in bed,\" the researchers said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/01/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html',1,192),(144,'The Delta variant leaves children vulnerable to Covid-19. Here\'s how to protect your children','As the more contagious While many Americans have taken the opportunity to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, children younger than 12 are still unable to receive the vaccine., Unvaccinated people -- including children -- are more vulnerable because it is more transmissible, said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She\'s also the author the forthcoming book \"Lifelines: A Doctor\'s Journey in the Fight for Public Health\" and the parent of two young children., \"I\'m concerned about the Delta variant,\" US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN Wednesday. \"I am worried that what we are seeing in terms of a plateauing of cases nationally but also an increase in cases in many small sections of the United States, that is, in fact, being driven by the Delta variant.\", Parents have the freedom to decide how they want to protect their children, Wen said, but there are some strategies to lower their children\'s risk of contracting the Delta variant. , , CNN: How is the Delta variant different from the original strain of Covid-19? , Dr. Leana Wen: There are three things that we should assess when looking at new variants. The first is transmissibility. The Delta variant is about 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which was the one that was already more contagious than the existing wild-type variants that were in the US. Unvaccinated people are even more likely to get infected with the Delta variant than any of the other variants we\'ve seen thus far during the pandemic. , The second consideration is virulence. There is some UK data that suggests that people who are infected with the Delta variant are more likely to be hospitalized and to experience severe illness., The third is about whether the vaccines we have will provide immune protection against the Delta variant. It does appear that the vaccines we have do work against the Delta variant. They appear to be less effective against Delta than they were against Alpha and other previously dominant variants., , CNN: Children younger than 12 in the US are not eligible for Covid-19 vaccines yet. How careful do parents need to be?, Wen: This is something I think a lot about as a parent of two young children, ages 1 and almost 4, and why I have been very concerned about the lifting of indoor mask mandates. I\'m not concerned about my children or other unvaccinated children who are around fully vaccinated people, but I\'m very concerned about unvaccinated people being around others who are also unvaccinated -- whether they\'re children or adults., Because the Delta variant is so much more contagious, there is no room for error. If there is somebody who is infected who is unvaccinated and there are other unvaccinated people around, there is a higher likelihood that those unvaccinated people are going to contract Covid-19 -- and that includes children. I would continue to urge unvaccinated people to behave as if there is high risk to them because the pandemic is not over for those who are unvaccinated. , , CNN: What are some specific strategies parents can implement to keep their unvaccinated children safe?, Wen: Different parents are making different decisions when it comes to risk, and that\'s OK. My family is choosing to be very cautious for the time being. And what that means is we are happy to have our children participate in playdates and socialize in outdoor settings. We invite people over to our backyard; we go to other people\'s backyards and meet other families in pools and parks.  It\'s not necessary for kids to wear masks outdoors, and we do not socialize with unvaccinated people indoors. , CNN: What should parents take into consideration when sending their children to summer camp?, Wen: My son is going to a camp that is predominantly outdoors. We\'re happy to do that and not wear masks in outdoor spaces. If we\'re indoors, we will only have our children be around other fully vaccinated people. If they\'re going to be indoors with other people who are unvaccinated at camp, they need to be wearing masks. Ideally, meals at camp are served outdoors. If they are served indoors, kids should be spaced at least 6 feet apart while eating and not wearing masks., , , For camps for those 12 and older, ideally, they require vaccination. If they do that, then it would be a very safe environment and they can do away with masks and distancing. If there are people of mixed vaccination status, then masks should still be required indoors. , Every family needs to decide the level of risk that they want to take together as a household. Some families might be OK with their children engaging with others indoors who are unvaccinated. Many parents will want to be more cautious. And if that\'s the case, they might consider asking the camp if they could impose a mask mandate. If most other kids are not wearing masks, and your child is made uncomfortable for the choice to mask indoors, parents could consider pulling their kids out. , , CNN: For families hoping to travel this summer, what should parents look out for when traveling with their unvaccinated children?, Wen: Again, this depends on the risk tolerance of the family, and mine is being particularly cautious. We are very comfortable traveling by car because we\'re able to control the places that we stop at. We\'re also comfortable staying in an Airbnb or a hotel and going to outdoor restaurants, but we\'re not going to go to indoor restaurants with our unvaccinated children. , We would take my almost 4-year-old, who is very good about masking, on a flight. With my 1-year-old, who cannot wear a mask, we would not.  , , , If you\'re visiting an amusement park, they can be safe and low risk if you stick to outdoor activities. Avoid indoor settings and try to avoid places with large crowds.  , The travel itself isn\'t what worries me the most. It\'s what people choose to do once they get to their destination. Make sure that the kids are also staying outdoors for meals. We don\'t want for there to be a lot of care taken, for example, wearing a mask on a flight or staying outdoors at an amusement park, only for the entire family to go to an indoor restaurant or to socialize with extended family or friends indoors who are unvaccinated.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/30/health/delta-variant-children-leana-wen-wellness/index.html',1,193),(145,'The Delta variant has now been detected in all 50 states and Washington, DC','The The last state to report the variant is South Dakota, which confirmed its first case on Tuesday., With the more transmissible variant spreading, this puts even more pressure on local and state officials to vaccinate more people. , Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday he\'s \"very concerned about\" the stark disparity between places with low and high vaccination rates. This unfortunately could lead to there soon being \"two Americas\" -- one where most people are vaccinated and another where low vaccination rates could lead to case spikes., \"When you have such a low level of vaccination superimposed upon a variant that has a high degree of efficiency of spread, what you are going to see among undervaccinated regions -- be that states, cities or counties -- you\'re going to see these individual types of blips,\" he said. \"It\'s almost like it\'s going to be two Americas.\" , Young people -- age 18 to 24 -- are still a group that officials are trying to get vaccinated. The proportion of young people hospitalized is increasing, according to Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. , Since May, people ages 12 to 29 have accounted for about a third of hospitalizations -- a greater proportion than in the past, Walensky said. CDC data shows, however, that vaccination coverage among young adults is improving. Over the past two weeks, the 18-24 age group made up 12.6% of those becoming fully vaccinated, the CDC said. , But spikes in coronavirus cases are \"entirely avoidable, entirely preventable\" with vaccination, said Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases., Fauci\'s remarks come as the Delta variant, which is more contagious and aggressive, has reached nearly every state and accounted for 26.1% of US Covid-19 cases as of Tuesday, according to the  CDC. , \"I\'m concerned about the Delta variant,\" US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN on Wednesday. \"And I am worried that what we are seeing in terms of a plateauing of cases nationally but also an increase in cases in many small sections of the United States, that that is, in fact, being driven by the Delta variant.\" , There is still a lot of virus circulating in the US, and close to 300 people -- \"just far too many\" -- are still dying daily from the coronavirus, Murthy said, citing data from recent weeks. , \"This is not over, and the virus wins when we let our guard down, when we take our eye off the ball,\" he said. \"We\'ve seen many times that it\'s fooled us in the past. We\'ve got to stay vigilant, got to get vaccinated, we\'ve got to talk to other people about getting vaccinated.\" , Indeed, the rise and spread of more transmissible coronavirus variants are changing the equation for achieving herd immunity -- the point at which enough people are protected against a virus to suppress its spread -- a coronavirus specialist told CNN on Tuesday., \"Every time a virus gets better at transmitting, the number of people that have to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity increases,\" said Andrew Pekosz, a professor of immunology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who is studying the coronavirus., \"Certainly, we are not out of the woods yet because we haven\'t had a vaccination rate where we get those herd immunity effects.\", Places with low vaccination rates are especially vulnerable to the Delta variant, experts have said., In Mississippi, where just 29.7% of the population is fully vaccinated, unvaccinated people have accounted for more than 90% of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the past month, said Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the state health officer for the Mississippi Department of Public Health. , Mississippi joins Alabama, Arkansas, Wyoming, and Louisiana in having less than 35% of residents fully vaccinated., Mask guidance stays the same in most places , Even as the Delta variant spreads, most mask guidance and policies don\'t appear poised to change. , \"For now, the CDC recommendations stand that if in fact you are vaccinated -- fully vaccinated -- you are protected, and you do not need to wear a mask outdoors or indoors,\" Fauci said. , Policies around masks on planes and public transport aren\'t expected to change soon, Walensky said Wednesday on ABC\'s \"Good Morning America.\" , \"Vaccinated people can take off their masks and celebrate July Fourth and feel safe in doing so, see each other smile again,\" she added. \"And then we\'re really going to have to continue the hard work that we are doing to get people vaccinated and for those who are not to continue to protect them with mask wearing and distancing because of this Delta variant.\", Children under 12 -- who aren\'t yet eligible for coronavirus vaccines -- should continue to wear masks indoors until the Delta variant is under control in the US, Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN on Wednesday. , Local differences in where the variant has spread means parents need to fully understand the risk in their area, he added. , \"A lot of it has to do with where you are,\" Hotez said. \"If you\'re in the Northeast, where transmission is really low, then your kids are a lot safer than in parts of the south-central US right now, where the epidemic is really taking off, that one-two punch of the Delta variant and low vaccination rates.\", Regardless of age or vaccination status, Los Angeles County has brought back its voluntary guidance to wear masks until health officials can \"better understand how and to who the Delta variant is spreading,\" the county\'s department of public health said., And while nearly all the staff at Johns Hopkins\' public health school in Baltimore are vaccinated against Covid-19, they are still wearing masks to work, Pekosz told CNN., \"We still have a masking policy here, particularly in group situations,\" he said. \"This pandemic isn\'t over yet.\", Los Angeles County appears to be the only county so far to recommend wearing masks in response to the spread of the Delta variant, the National Association of County and City Health Officials told CNN on Tuesday. But health officials are continuing to monitor the spread of the variant in the US, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, the group\'s chief executive officer., Nationally, the number of people practicing safety measures, such as social distancing and masking, continues to decrease, even as 84% of Americans have heard of the Delta variant, a poll published Tuesday by Axios-Ipsos showed. The poll, conducted Friday through Monday, comprised of a nationally representative sample of 1,106 adults. , Meantime, most adults who plan to get the Covid-19 vaccine have already done so, another poll shows., A Kaiser Family Foundation report released Wednesday shows 65% of adults polled have received at least one dose of the vaccine, up from 62% in May. Only 3% of those who haven\'t been vaccinated said they plan to do so as soon as they can. About 14% said they will definitely not get vaccinated., In the long term, the cost of the pandemic is not just lives lost but also the mental health and well-being of people across the country, Murthy told CNN on Wednesday. , \"We have a long way to go to recover from this pandemic,\" he said. \"We can only do it together, but it starts with us getting vaccinated.\", Covid-19 cases among children are dropping , While children under 12 aren\'t yet eligible to receive a Covid-19 vaccine, but there is some good news about declining cases., More than 8,400 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in children last week, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics\' weekly report, the lowest weekly number of cases since May 2020. , Children represented about 10% of reported Covid-19 cases last week. More than 4.03 million children have tested positive for Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. , The decline in cases among children comes as the new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation indicates Covid-19 vaccination rates among children ages 12 to 17 years are rising. About 34% of parents said their eligible children have received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, up from 24% in May. About 8% said they plan to get their 12- to 17-year-old children vaccinated right away. , Data for vaccine efficacy in children under 12 may be analyzed \"in the fall/winter timeframe,\" according to Dr. Peter Marks, director of the US Food and Drug Administration\'s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research., \"It makes sense that it\'s going to take a little longer there, because there had to be dose de-escalation -- lower doses used, essentially dose de-escalation -- and as well as we want to see longer follow-up data to make sure that we have the kind of safety in that population,\" Marks said.  , Vaccines protect against Delta variant, experts say, As variants spread, health experts are urging people to get fully vaccinated so they can have maximum protection., Two weeks after the second dose, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is 88% effective against symptomatic infections caused by the Delta variant, Fauci has said. Those who received only one dose have less protection. , Moderna\'s vaccine was found in lab experiments to work against new variants including the Delta strain, the company said Tuesday. Serum samples from people who received two shots of the Moderna vaccine showed neutralizing activity against the variants, Moderna said in a pre-print study that hasn\'t yet been peer-reviewed., As for the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine, it\'s \"highly likely\" it can protect against the Delta variant, though it hasn\'t been proven through research yet, Fauci said., Two doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, which uses the same platform as the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, are about 88% effective against the Delta variant, and \"you can make the reasonable assumption\" the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine will be \"just as good,\" Fauci said. , As of Tuesday, 46.4% of the US population was fully vaccinated, CDC data showed. Sixteen states have fully vaccinated more than half of their population. And 16 states have reached President Joe Biden\'s goal to vaccinate 70% of adults with at least one dose by July 4.

Four major Australian cities went into a four-day \"circuit-breaker\" lockdown this week to try and stop it from spreading. Australia\'s Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, announced looser vaccination policies to try to get more people immunized before the variant could spread. Ireland delayed plans to resume indoor service in bars and restaurants and US officials urged Americans to get vaccinated to stop its spread.The World Health Organization says the Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, has spread to at least 85 countries since it was first identified in India last fall., Here\'s what is known about the variant so far:, It\'s spreading fast, By mid-June, the Delta variant accounted for 99% of Covid-19 cases in the UK, according to Public Health England, and it is set to account for 90% of cases in Europe by the end of August, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control., In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now estimates the variant accounts for 26% of new Covid-19 cases -- or at least, that it did as of June 19. It\'s been reported in all 50 states, plus Washington, D.C., It accounted for 10% of lineages as of June 5, meaning its prevalence more than doubled in just two weeks. ,  , Genetic testing company Helix tells CNN it estimates Delta accounts for 40% of cases in the US at present., \"Every two weeks for the last month or two this has been doubling,\" Dr. Mark Mulligan, director of the NYU Langone Vaccine Center, told an International Antiviral Society--USA briefing Tuesday., \"The data from England has shown that it outcompeted the Alpha variant in that population. That is strong head to head evidence that it is a better transmitter,\" Andrew Pekosz, a professor of immunology and molecular microbiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told CNN., \"Here in the US it is doing very similar things. It seems to be on its way to becoming the dominant lineage in the US.\", Testing for any variant is imperfect. Standard tests to diagnose Covid-19 cannot tell which variant someone is infected with. Samples must be shipped to special labs for genomic testing, so the CDC and companies such as Helix extrapolate from the actual test results they get back., It\'s more transmissible, \"Delta is the most transmissible of the variants identified so far,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said Friday., The virus carries a cluster of mutations, including one known as L452R, that helps it infect human cells more easily., \"We learned this virus, a variant of Covid, is highly transmissible -- the most transmissible we\'ve seen to date,\" US Surgeon-General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN Wednesday., \"This is, again, a serious threat and we are seeing it spread among unvaccinated people.\", The ECDC estimates its about 40% to 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant -- making it about half again as contagious., Vaccines protect against it - but not perfectly, Real life and laboratory evidence both suggest that fully vaccinated people are protected against the Delta variant. , \"The good news is if you are vaccinated -- and fully vaccinated means two weeks after your last shot -- then there is good evidence that you have a high degree of protection against this virus,\" Murthy told CNN\'s Erica Hill Wednesday. \"But if you are not vaccinated, then you are in trouble.\", Vaccine maker Moderna released results Tuesday showing that blood taken from vaccinated people could neutralize Delta, as well as other variants including Alpha, the Beta or B.1.351 variant first seen in South African, and Gamma, or P.1, which has swept Brazil., \"Vaccines can handle it,\" Mulligan said. \"In most cases, we have a cushion of magnitude in circulating antibody and other cellular responses. The vaccines are able to handle this.\", , , And in US states with lower vaccination rates, the Delta variant is more prevalent than in states where the majority of the populations are immunized., In Missouri, for example, data from Johns Hopkins University shows the infection rate is about 3.5 times the national average. And CDC data shows Delta accounts for about 57.5% of cases in the region that includes Missouri, where under 40% of the population is fully vaccinated, compared to 47% of the US population overall. , But none of the coronavirus vaccines are 100% effective, so there can be infections even in fully vaccinated people., \"It is possible that you will see people who are infected get breakthrough infections,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN\'s Don Lemon Tuesday., , \"We haven\'t formally proven yet how much diminution there is in the likelihood of transmitting it to someone else -- including children -- and that\'s one of the reasons why you\'ve got to be careful when you\'re dealing with something like the Delta variant,\" said Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases., \"With millions of people getting vaccinated against COVID-19, some people who are fully vaccinated will still get sick if they are exposed,\" CDC spokesperson Jade Fulce told CNN in an email Friday., \"However, people with breakthrough infections may get less severely ill or have a shorter illness than they would have if they had not been vaccinated.\", Everyday measures prevent transmission, There\'s nothing about the Delta variant that makes it different in terms of how it transmits. Coronaviruses are passed in the air and, to a smaller degree, on surfaces that people may touch., Masks, physical distancing and good ventilation all work to prevent transmission, as does handwashing and keeping surfaces clean. , It\'s not clear whether it it\'s more dangerous, While some public officials have said they believe the Delta variant is more dangerous that other lineages of the virus, there\'s no hard evidence showing this., The cluster of defining mutations on Delta indicate it is more transmissible and can hide to a small degree from the body\'s immune response, but none suggest it is more virulent or more pathogenic -- that is causes more severe disease., It does not carry two other worrying mutations known as E484K and N501Y -- which are seen in the B.1.1.7 or Alpha variant first seen in Britain, which swept many countries at the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and also in the B.1.351 variant of Beta variant first seen in South Africa, and well as the P.1 or Gamma variant., , , \"It has a few unique mutations, particularly in the spike protein, that would suggest it is able to bind to human cells better and perhaps evade antibody responses that target the spike protein,\" Pekosz said., That could mean people who were infected with earlier lineages of coronavirus and recovered could more easily get infected with Delta. It also suggests antibody-based treatments might be slightly less effective. , But as shown in laboratory tests, the vaccines cause an overwhelming immune response,  stronger and broader than natural infection, that should protect most vaccinated people against serious illness and even mild infection.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/30/health/delta-variant-covid-what-known/index.html',1,197),(147,'Does spinach make you strong? Ask Popeye -- and science','If you were a kid raised anytime between the 1930s and the 1970s -- or raised by someone who was raised then -- chances are good that you grew up with the idea that spinach was a muscle builder par excellence. We owe that notion to a comic-strip cartoonist named Elzie Crisler Segar, who created a character that he based on a rough-edged, hard-drinking local from his Illinois hometown. Segar christened the character \"Popeye,\" a sailor who debuted in a strip in 1929. , By 1933, when he began to appear as one of the lead characters in an animated cartoon series called \"Thimble Theatre,\" Popeye was getting instant strength from spinach. , And he needed it, thanks to an assortment of enemies on the high seas and terra firma alike. Whenever the diminutive mariner downed a can of spinach, muscles inflated, enabling him to pound the stuffing out of his archnemesis -- a piratical sailor called Bluto -- who was much larger and sturdier, but lacking that secret green rocket fuel., The legend of Popeye -- and the source of his superpower -- long outlasted the character. But, experts say, answering the question of whether spinach really does make us stronger takes some complicated turns. , The science of spinach, One point that could support the spinach-strength connection is that it contains plenty of nitrates, \"which might improve muscle endurance,\" said Norman Hord, chair of the University of Oklahoma\'s Department of Nutritional Sciences. These nitrates are rapidly depleted during exercise or physical exertion and replenishing them \"increases force production in exercising skeletal muscle.\" , \"More research is being done now to determine if increased nitrate in muscle translates to increase muscle strength and improved athletic performance,\" Hord added., Fitness and exercise guru Timothy Ferriss (born in 1977 and perhaps too young to have caught the Popeye bug) does not cite the ack-ack-acking sailor when, in his book \"The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life,\" he recommends a \"slow-carb\" diet of eggs, meat, fish, lentils and spinach as the quickest path to weight loss as well as overall fitness. , ,  , This jibes well with Hord\'s observation that spinach contains plenty of vitamin K, which helps lower blood pressure and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Unless it\'s cooked beyond recognition, spinach is also a good source of vitamin C.  It has no cholesterol or fat. , Harold McGee, the dean of culinary science, argued that there are better sources of strength-building minerals. \"Despite Popeye, spinach is not remarkably rich in iron, though it is a good source of vitamin A,\" he wrote in his now-classic book \"On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen.\"   , Though the iron of the pumping-iron set isn\'t what McGee means, it\'s iron that you want for sculpting bulging biceps and an admirable six-pack., How to get the benefits of spinach, Atlanta-based nutritionist Rahaf Al Bochi touts the vegetable\'s overall health benefits. , \"I recommend adding spinach to your eating pattern as it is loaded with antioxidants and vitamins such as folate, magnesium, and vitamin A, as well as fiber, which are important for reducing risk for chronic diseases,\" Al Bochi said., It\'s also loaded with other substances that boast a variety of benefits. Spinach has plenty of lutein, which is believed to support eye health and reduce the incidence of macular degeneration, a concern mostly of people 55 or older. The level of lutein drops substantially as spinach is cooked but is increased if used in liquefied form, so to gain this benefit, it\'s best eaten in a smoothie. according to a 2019 study published in Food Chemistry., , , , Leafy greens of many kinds, including cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and bok choy, are known to inhibit heart disease and stroke, as well as certain cancers. Spinach joins these, with the greatest benefits derived from these vegetables in their raw or lightly cooked form. , Finally, a diet that includes green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale and greens, containing all the good things that Al Bochi noted, seems to help slow cognitive decline. A 2018 study of 960 older adults published in Neurology reported that those who consumed 1.3 servings a day or more were, cognitively speaking, an average of 11 years younger than those who included little or no leafy vegetables in their diet. , Are there any drawbacks?, Even with all its potential, Popeye\'s favorite food does have a few downsides. Spinach, especially raw spinach, can lend some people a, well, gassy air. Spinach may taste bland to some palates, but it contains enough sodium naturally that salt doesn\'t need to be added to it—if you want to perk it up, it\'s better to add lemon juice than salt, since too much sodium is empathically not a good thing. , \"Too much of any food is not healthy,\" Hord said. \"Spinach contains oxalic acid, which may bind minerals in the diet, like calcium, and render them unavailable for absorption.\" , , , , If you\'re concerned about getting enough calcium in your system, it may be well to leave spinach out of the cheesy lasagnas in which it is so often deployed. Too much oxalic acid is also a recipe for kidney stones, and therefore, Hord added, \"this may negatively affect people\" who are susceptible to them., The vitamin K in spinach also \"can interfere with the function of blood thinners like warfarin. People taking blood thinners may want to limit their intake of spinach for this reason,\" Hord said. , Adding spinach to your diet, Now, with all these provisos in mind, what\'s the best way to put spinach to work? All due respect to Popeye, a can may not be the tastiest way to introduce it to your table. Many people enjoy raw spinach in their salad. This is usually fine -- just remember that spinach can be a good vehicle for E. coli, Listeria and other harmful bacteria and germs. , , , For this reason, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that spinach be cooked at 160º for 15 seconds, which kills potentially fatal bacteria.  Lightly sautéing fresh spinach in a drizzle of olive or avocado oil meets this baseline, and it\'s tasty and nutritious as well. Another option is to wash spinach and other leafy greens thoroughly in running water before eating them.,  \"It\'s so versatile and can be enjoyed raw or cooked. You can enjoy spinach added to salads, smoothies, muffins, sautéed in stir fries, soups, and in pesto,\" Al Bochi said., It\'s versatile and tasty, to be sure. But does spinach make you strong? Perhaps not explosively strong, Popeye strong. But spinach has plenty of other merits, so if you\'ve got a yen for the green stuff, don\'t hesitate to enjoy it. Just not out of a can, if you please.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/01/health/spinach-strong-muscles-myth-facts-wellness/index.html',1,198);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (148,'Too much Southern food can cause a sudden heart attack, but Mediterranean diet reduced risk','You don\'t have to be Southern to love fried chicken, buttered biscuits, sausage gravy, sweet tea or any of the other fried and fat- or sugar-laden foods typical of thisBut a new study found eating a steady diet of traditional Southern food can make you 46% more likely to die from a sudden cardiac death -- that\'s when the heart suddenly stops -- than people who don\'t often eat those foods., Sudden cardiac death is a common cause of death and \"accounted for 1 in every 7.5 deaths in the United States in 2016, or nearly 367,000 deaths,\" according to an American Heart Association statement. When this type of heart attack occurs, the AHA says, death typically comes within an hour., The study, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association, also examined the impact of eating a Mediterranean-style diet on the risk of sudden cardiac death., Researchers found people who most closely followed the traditional Mediterranean diet had a 26% lower risk of sudden cardiac death than people who rarely ate the Mediterranean way. However, this was only true for people with no history of coronary heart disease at the start of the study. , \"Improving one\'s diet -- by eating a diet abundant in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fish such as the Mediterranean diet -- and low in fried foods, organ meats and processed meats, characteristics of the Southern-style dietary pattern, may decrease one\'s risk for sudden cardiac death,\" said lead author James Shikany, in a statement. , Shikany is a professor of medicine and associate director for research in the Division of Preventive Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham., Stroke belt , In what researchers are calling the first observational study to evaluate the role of dietary patterns in sudden cardiac death, the team analyzed data from a national study called Regards (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke). , Sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, Regards was designed to discover why \"Southerners and Black Americans have higher rates of stroke and related diseases that affect brain health.\" The study enrolled 30,239 Black and White participants between 2003 and 2007 and followed them for 10 years., Shikany and his team examined data from some 21,000 people. More than half were from the \"stroke belt,\" an area of 11 states in the Southeast where rates of stroke are traditionally high. For this study, those states included North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana., According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people who live in the stroke belt are two to four times more likely to die from stroke than in other regions of the country. Prior studies have shown that people eating a predominately Southern diet had a higher risk of death from any cause and a greater risk of coronary heart disease., The study raised some interesting health equity and food security concerns, said Dr. Stephen Juraschek, a member of the American Heart Association\'s Nutrition Committee, who was not involved in the study., \"The authors describe the \'Southern Diet\' based on the U.S. geography associated with this dietary pattern, yet it would be a mistake for us to assume that this is a diet of choice,\" said Juraschek, in a statement., \"The gap in healthy eating between people with means and those without continues to grow in the U.S., and there is an incredible need to understand the complex societal factors that have led and continue to perpetuate these disparities,\" he added. , Five dietary patterns, The study looked at five dietary patterns: People who regularly ate sweets; those who mostly ate fast food and other convenience items; a \"salad and alcohol\" pattern which mixed beer, wine and alcohol with salad fixings; a plant-based diet (such as Mediterranean); and the traditional Southern diet., \"All participants had some level of adherence to each pattern, but usually adhered more to some patterns and less to others,\" Shikany said. \"For example, it would not be unusual for an individual who adheres highly to the Southern pattern to also adhere to the plant-based pattern, but to a much lower degree.\", Besides the decrease in risk for sudden heart attack from a plant-based diet, the study also found something unusual: People with a history of heart disease who ate a lot of sweets had a 51% lower risk of sudden cardiac death than those who ate few sweets. , Why would that be? Researchers had no idea, saying there was \"no viable explanation for the inverse association of the sweets dietary pattern with risk of sudden cardiac death in those with a history of coronary heart disease.\", Plant-based diets, It\'s not surprising that a plant-based diet was shown to be healthier for the heart. Three plant-based diets, the Mediterranean, the Ornish and the DASH diet tied for the top spot in the 2021 U.S. News and World Report ranking of best heart-healthy diets., The Ornish diet was created in 1977 by Dr. Dean Ornish, founder of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute in California. Ornish calls the diet the only scientifically proven program to reverse heart disease in a randomized clinical trial without drugs or surgery. Experts have said the diet is restrictive and hard to follow, however., The DASH diet is often recommended to lower blood pressure. Studies have shown that following the DASH diet can reduce blood pressure in a matter of weeks., Its premise is simple: Eat more veggies, fruits and low-fat dairy foods while cutting way back on any food high in saturated fat and limit your intake of salt., The meal plan includes three whole-grain products each day, four to six servings of vegetables, four to six servings of fruit, two to four servings of dairy products and several servings each of lean meats and nuts/seeds/legumes., The Mediterranean diet features simple, plant-based cooking, with the majority of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra virgin olive oil. , Say goodbye to refined sugar and flour except on rare occasions. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all., Red meat can make a rare appearance, usually only to flavor a dish. Instead, meals may include eggs, dairy and poultry, but in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet. Fish, however, are a staple., Numerous studies have found the Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer. Meals from the sunny Mediterranean region have also been linked to stronger bones, a healthier heart and longer life. , \"To the extent that they can, people should evaluate the number of servings of fruit and vegetables they consume each day and try to increase the number to at least 5-6 servings per day, as recommended by the American Heart Association,\" Juraschek said in the statement. \"Optimal would be 8-9 servings per day.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/01/health/mediterranean-diet-southern-food-wellness/index.html',1,199),(149,'Child Covid-19 hospitalizations reach a new high. That\'s not the only reason kids need to be protected from Delta, doctors say','More kids were hospitalized with Covid-19 this month than any other time this past year -- proving Between August 20 and 26, an average of 330 children were admitted to hospitals every day with Covid-19, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. , , That\'s the highest rate of new Covid-19 hospitalizations among children in more than a year -- a record that was broken several times in August, according to CDC data., \"This virus that we\'re dealing with now is a game changer,\" said Dr. Mark Kline, physician-in-chief of Children\'s Hospital New Orleans., \"It\'s just so easily transmitted from person-to-person.\" As of August 9, he said, \"half of the children that we\'ve admitted have been under the age of 2.\", Doctors say it\'s crucial to protect children against the Delta variant -- not just for the sake of their health and to keep in-person learning, but also to help prevent more aggressive variants from setting the entire country back., , 204,000 new pediatric cases in one week, Since the last school year, a more contagious variant -- Alpha -- has been replaced by an even more contagious variant -- Delta -- as the dominant strain of coronavirus in the US. , In just two months, Delta jumped from 3% to more than 93% of sequenced coronavirus samples in the US, the CDC said., Now, Covid-19 cases among children have \"increased exponentially,\" the American Academy of Pediatrics said Tuesday. , During the week ending August 26, about more than 200,000 new childhood Covid-19 cases were reported, the AAP said. , That\'s a \"five-fold increase the past month, rising from about 38,000 cases the week ending July 22nd to nearly 204,000 the past week.\", Among kids getting hospitalized with Covid-19, many were previously healthy., Almost half -- 46.4% -- of children hospitalized with Covid-19 between March 2020 and June 2021 had no known underlying condition, according to CDC data from almost 100 US counties. , MIS-C and long Covid can leave lasting impacts, Long-term Covid-19 complications can be significant for children -- even for some who initially had mild or no symptoms, the American Academy of Pediatrics said., All pediatric patients who tested positive should have at least one follow-up exam with a pediatrician, the AAP said. , Pediatricians should watch out for residual or long-term Covid-19 problems such as respiratory symptoms, which can last three months or more; heart issues, including a type of heart inflammation known as myocarditis; cognitive problems such as \"brain fog\"; headache; fatigue and mental health issues, the AAP said., Children who had moderate or severe Covid-19 may be at greater risk for subsequent heart disease, the pediatrician group said., In some cases, children who start with mild or even no symptoms from Covid-19 end up hospitalized weeks or months later with a condition called MIS-C -- multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children., MIS-C is \"a rare but serious condition associated with COVID-19 in which different body parts become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs,\" the CDC says., It happens when \"the virus induces your body to make an immune response against your own blood vessels\" -- which can cause inflammation of the blood vessels, said pediatrician Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\'s Hospital in Philadelphia., Often, children with MIS-C don\'t start off very sick with Covid-19., \"Usually children are picked up incidentally as having (coronavirus). Someone in the family was infected, a friend was infected, so they got a PCR test. And they\'re found to be positive. ... Then they\'re fine,\" Offit said., \"Then a month goes by, and they develop a high fever. And evidence of lung, liver, kidney or heart damage. That\'s when they come to our hospital.\", At least 4,404 cases of MIS-C had been reported between February 2020 and July 2021, including 37 deaths, the CDC said. , It said 99% of MIS-C patients had tested positive for coronavirus, and the other 1% had contact with someone with Covid-19. , The median age of patients with MIS-C was 9 years old. , \"CDC is working to learn more about why some children and adolescents develop MIS-C after having COVID-19 or contact with someone with COVID-19, while others do not,\" the CDC says. , \"Based on what we know now about MIS-C, the best way you can protect your child is by taking everyday actions to prevent your child and the entire household from getting the virus that causes COVID-19.\", The best steps parents can take include getting vaccinated and vaccinating children ages 12 and up, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said., And even if a parent is fully vaccinated, there\'s a small chance they could catch an asymptomatic breakthrough infection and pass the virus to their children., That\'s why it\'s a good idea for all parents of young children to wear masks in public indoor settings, Walensky said.  , But the best way to protect unvaccinated children, she said, \"is to surround them with vaccinated people.\", Protecting kids from Covid-19 is critical to keep them in schools, With the highly contagious Delta variant, the CDC recommends students from kindergarten through grade 12, along with teachers and visitors, wear masks in school. , The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends masks in schools for everyone older than 2. , \"Our children deserve to have full-time, in person, safe learning with prevention measures in place. And that includes masking for everyone in schools,\" Walensky said. , Some students are returning to schools for the first time in a year. But long-awaited classroom learning can be quickly derailed by an infection or outbreak. , In Mississippi and Florida, thousands of students just starting their school year have already had to quarantine. , And it doesn\'t take much for Covid-19 to shut down a school again. Even one case can have a ripple effect on students, faculty and staff. , \"We need adults to run schools, and if my adults are sick or needing to quarantine, I don\'t have adults present to provide the education,\" said Carlee Simon, superintendent of Alachua County Public Schools in Florida., \"When we have families that don\'t want to have masks on their child, what they\'re doing is not only (increasing the) chance they will have to be quarantined,\" Simon said. , If a student gets infected, \"they will also have other students who did have masks on who would also need to be quarantined.\" , \"Everybody wants to move forward. Nobody wants to have masks forever,\" Simon said. But \"we would like to be able to be safe and have instructional time with our students.\", In addition to masks in schools, the CDC recommends layering other strategies such as improved ventilation, physical distancing and testing on a screening basis., Children can accidentally help spur new variants , Protecting children from getting Covid-19 can help everyone in the long run, doctors say., As coronavirus keeps spreading, replicating itself in new people, the more chances it has to mutate -- potentially leading to even more contagious variants or one that might evade vaccines. , \"That\'s, of course, the concern,\" Walensky said. , Fully vaccinated people are less likely to get infected with the Delta variant. , But unvaccinated people -- including unvaccinated children -- are more susceptible to infection. And they can unknowingly help with the creation of new variants, Offit said. , \"If we are going to continue to allow this virus to spread, we\'re going to continue to allow these variants to be created,\" he said. , \"We\'re not going to be able to stop this pandemic until we have a significant percentage of the population vaccinated.\", Covid-19 deaths in children shouldn\'t be ignored, CDC chief says, While children are far less likely to die from Covid-19 than adults, the deaths are still significant, Walensky said. , At least 496 US children have died from Covid-19, according to CDC data. For the 2019-20 flu season, the CDC reported 199 confirmed pediatric flu deaths and an estimated 434 pediatric flu deaths., One reason Covid-19 is deadlier for children than other infectious diseases is because many children are vaccinated against other diseases, said Dr. James Campbell, professor of pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine., \"Nobody\'s dying of polio, nobody\'s dying of measles in the United States. Nobody\'s dying of diphtheria,\" Campbell said., But while children ages 12 to 17 can get a Covid-19 vaccine, many have not done so. And it could be several more months before a vaccine is authorized for children younger than 12. , Rebecca Calloway\'s 7-year-old daughter, Georgia, is one of thousands of young children testing various doses of Covid-19 vaccines to make sure they\'re safe and effective before they get authorized. , Part of the reason Calloway enrolled Georgia in the pediatric vaccine trial is because she recently lost her 3-year-old daughter to another unexpected disease -- Type 1 diabetes -- and doesn\'t want any more families to lose a child to Covid-19., While childhood deaths from Covid-19 and Type 1 diabetes are rare, Calloway said, \"You don\'t want to be that statistic.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/31/health/covid-delta-variant-children/index.html',1,200),(150,'This is how to prevent another 100,000 Covid deaths by December, Fauci says','With \"What is going on now is both entirely predictable, but entirely preventable,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN\'s Jake Tapper Sunday, saying the outcome of the model is possible. \"We know we have the wherewithal with vaccines to turn this around.\", Around 80 million eligible Americans are still not vaccinated -- the very group that could help turn the pandemic around, Fauci said., \"We could do it efficiently and quickly if we just get those people vaccinated. That\'s why it\'s so important now, in this crisis that we\'re in that people put aside any ideologic, political or other differences, and just get vaccinated,\" he said., With a daily average of 155,000 newly reported infections, many hospitals are buckling under the weight of another surge., Across the south last week, many hospitals were reporting oxygen shortages amid a rise in hospitalizations from the virus., Among those hospitalizations were pediatric patients, which have also been increasing since students returned to classrooms in some areas., Thousands of children were in quarantine over the past week due to Covid-19 exposure, creating an uncertain start to the school year as officials, teachers and parents weigh safety precautions., In Florida alone, at least 21,869 students and 4,481 employees have tested positive for Covid-19 in the 15 largest school districts since school started, according to a CNN analysis. And 45,024 students and staff members have been quarantined or put on \"stay home\" directives after possible exposure to the virus. , On Monday, data presented by a vaccine adviser from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed a hospitalization rate 16 times greater in the unvaccinated population than in those vaccinated. ,  \"This to me seems to be a strong indication that the current epidemiologic curve that we\'re seeing is really a reflection of failure to vaccinate, not vaccine failure,\"  Dr. Matthew F. Daley said at the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (AICP) meeting., Vaccines a possibility for children under 12 in coming months, While vaccines are currently the best defense against the spread of the virus, they have not yet been approved for those under the age of 12., For these children, masking and vaccination of the adults and teens around them are their only protection. But that could change in the coming months., Pfizer is working to file data that would help authorize its vaccine for those ages 5 to 11, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said Sunday on CBS. , Gottlieb, who is on the board of Pfizer, said the drug maker could be in a position to file the data for authorization \"at some point in September.\", He went on to say that Pfizer could then file the application for Emergency Use Authorization for this age group \"potentially as early as October.\", Gottlieb told CBS\'s Ed O\'Keefe Sunday that \"we have to throw everything we can\" at minimizing cases among school children. , \"I don\'t think that we should be going into the school year lifting the mitigation that may have worked and probably did work last year to control outbreaks in the school setting, until we have firm evidence on what works and what doesn\'t,\" he explained, adding measures such as frequent testing and putting students in social pods \"are probably the two most effective steps schools can be taking.\", Schools that have been successful in mitigating spread include those that frequently test, contact trace, and set quarantine protocols when a positive case is detected., \"Using masks and improving ventilation is also going to be very important. And finally, getting kids vaccinated. About 50% of kids who are eligible to be vaccinated, have been vaccinated. So there\'s still a lot of work we can do there, getting parents more information trying to encourage parents to vaccinate their children,\" Gottlieb added., Fauci echoed those sentiments when he told CNN Sunday he would support a mandate for school children to be vaccinated should the FDA approve use of the vaccine in those under 12. , \"I believe that mandating vaccines for children to appear in school is a good idea,\" Fauci said., He pointed out that this wouldn\'t be out of the question, saying that schools already have many vaccine mandates in place. , \"This is not something new. We have mandates in many places in schools, particularly public schools that if in fact you want a child to come in -- we\'ve done this for decades and decades requiring (vaccines for) polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis. So this would not be something new, requiring vaccinations for children to come to school,\" he explained., Boosters and treatments, , Those who are already vaccinated will still likely need a booster shot to fight the spread of new variants., Starting the week of September 20, those who received their second shot eight months ago should be eligible for their third, according to Fauci, who noted there is flexibility in the plan based on the data that is available., On Wednesday, Pfizer began submitting data to the FDA for approval of a third dose of its Covid-19 vaccine., On Monday, a Pfizer official said the company plans to have data from its trial on Covid-19 vaccine booster efficacy by late September or early October., Dr. William C. Gruber, the company\'s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, told the AICP there\'s data from Public Health England, Israel and others that speaks to the decline in vaccine efficacy over time and potential for boosters, but the company is hoping to provide a controlled study of the efficacy of boosters. , , \"I\'m figuring sort of late September, October time frame for actually being able to demonstrate the nature of efficacy,\" he said., Looking at data through July, the vaccines still appear to offer strong protection against severe illness, the CDC\'s Dr. Sara Oliver told the centers\' vaccine advisers at a meeting on Monday. , \"Regardless of the vaccine evaluated, all vaccines remain effective in preventing hospitalization and severe disease. But they may be less effective in preventing infection and mild illness recently,\" Oliver said. \"These reasons for lower effectiveness likely include both waning over time and the Delta variant.\", , Some hospitals in the Southern states reporting overflowing ICUs , The possibility of a third dose comes as many hospitals face an uptick in hospitalizations and a decrease in supplies, with cases in the south increasing as available oxygen -- a key component in treating those with the virus -- has decreased. , \"We\'ve had some very challenging situations over the last couple of weeks, where hospitals have had their oxygen deliveries disrupted with hours delay, putting them in a situation where they\'ve had very low oxygen supplies,\" Mary Mayhew, president and CEO of the Florida Hospital Association, told CNN. \"Hospitals are using 3-4 times the amount of oxygen they would normally use,\" she added. , Kentucky has more Covid-19 hospitalizations now than at any time in the pandemic, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday. , The state is getting \"hit harder than we ever did during that winter peak,\" Beshear said, adding \"this is as full-blown as we have ever been.\", More than 2,000 people are currently hospitalized and 615 are in the ICU, Beshear said., \"We\'re living in a reality where some Covid patients who are sick are being treated in their cars when there isn\'t room for them inside the ER or inside the hospital,\" Beshear said., Northeast Georgia Health System in Hall County has more Covid patients than it has had since January, CEO Carol Burrell said, adding that 84% are unvaccinated. , Dr. Erine Raybon-Rojas, a critical care physician at Northeast Georgia Health System, told CNN that resources are a constant and pressing challenge. , \"We need more critical care beds. We need more critical care physicians at any given time. There\'s been times where I\'ve literally started working and they\'ve had to open up a new ICU that day, out of a different floor. And it\'s been filled before I even leave to go home that shift.\" , In Louisiana, where Hurricane Ida caused widespread devastation, intensive care units are about 88% full, with 45% of those beds occupied by Covid-19 patients, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services., Another ongoing challenge in the fight against Covid has been misinformation, the latest example of which has people taking anti-parasitic medicine in an attempt to fight the virus., Texas K-12 schools surpass highest Covid-19 weekly total from last year, The Texas Health Department says 20,256 students and 7,488 employees have tested positive for Covid-19 throughout Texas districts that returned to school in August., That amounts to 0.38% of the state\'s 5,340,108 students and 0.93% of its 800,078 employees. Last week alone, 14,033 students tested positive for Covid-19 statewide, surpassing the highest weekly total from the prior school year. , In contrast, at its peak during the last school year, the state reported a total of 10,487 Covid-19 cases among students for the week ending January 10., Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, is putting its entire campus under quarantine for two weeks to \"slow the spread\" of Covid-19 among its student body., According to the university\'s Covid dashboard, there are currently 159 active cases -- 124 students and 35 staff members. That accounts for about 0.55% of the university\'s total population. , The university announced indoor classes will be moved online and no large indoor gatherings will be held during the \"temporary mitigation period\" starting today and going through September 10, but emphasized in a statement that this is not a \"campus wide lockdown.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/30/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html',1,201),(151,'South African researchers keep wary eye on yet another new coronavirus variant','Genetics researchers who have been watching for The variant they are watching, called C.1.2, has popped up across South Africa as well as in seven other countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, the researchers report. They\'re not sure whether its constellation of mutations will make it more dangerous, but it carries changes that have given other variants increased transmissibility and the ability to evade the immune system\'s response to some degree., Having more mutations does not necessarily equal more danger -- some mutations can weaken a virus and it\'s the combination of changes that affects whether a virus becomes more efficient. One extra mutation could cancel out the effects of another., But the team -- which includes virologist Penny Moore of South Africa\'s National Institute for Communicable Diseases -- say they are keeping an eye on it., \"We are currently assessing the impact of this variant on antibody neutralization following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa,\" they wrote in a report posted online as a preprint., , , \"This variant has been detected throughout the third wave of infections in South Africa from May 2021 onwards and has been detected in seven other countries within Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania. The identification of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants is commonly associated with new waves of infection.\", It\'s too soon for the variant to be designated a variant of interest or a variant of concern by the World Health Organization, so it does not yet have a Greek alphabet designation. WHO currently names four variants of concern, which are more easily transmitted, affect severity of disease or evade tests, vaccines or treatments: Alpha or B.1.1.7; Beta or B.1.351; Gamma or P.1; and Delta or B.1.617.2. Variants of interest, which have troubling mutations and have caused clusters of illness, include Eta or B.1.525; Iota or B.1.526; Kappa or B.1.617.1 and Lambda or C.37, according to WHO., , Maria van Kerkhove, technical lead on Covid-19 for WHO, noted that very few people diagnosed with coronavirus have been found to be infected with the C.1.2 variant., \"To date there are around 100 sequences of C.1.2 reported globally, the earliest reports from May \'21 from South Africa,\" she said on Twitter., \"At this time, C.1.2 does not appear to be rising in circulation,\" she added. She said WHO would update people on its website and via news conference if that changes., \"Monitoring &amp; assessment of variants is ongoing &amp; critically important to understand the evolution of this virus, in fighting COVID-19 &amp; adapting strategies as needed,\" she added. So far, the Delta variant is still dominant, Van Kerkhove said., , , Some variants, such as Alpha and Delta, have quickly spread to become the dominant variants in much of the world. Others have spread more regionally, including Beta and Gamma. Others have looked troubling but caused only sporadic outbreaks.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/30/health/new-coronavirus-variant-maybe/index.html',1,202),(152,'Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness against severe disease has not dropped much, CDC says','Overall effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines has not dropped much yet for most vaccinated Americans, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisers were told Monday.CDC\'s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met Monday to discuss the potential eventual need for booster doses of coronavirus vaccine -- although they did not vote. The White House has said it\'s planning to offer booster doses at the end of September, although it\'s up to the US Food and Drug Administration and the CDC to decide on this., So far, in data that goes through July, the vaccines still appear to provide strong protection, the CDC\'s Dr. Sara Oliver told ACIP Monday., , , \"Since the introduction of the Delta variant, VE against infection ranges from 39 to 84%. VE against hospitalization, though, remains high from 75% to 95%,\" Oliver said, citing global data., \"Regardless of the vaccine evaluated, all vaccines remain effective in preventing hospitalization and severe disease. But they may be less effective in preventing infection and mild illness recently,\" Oliver added. \"These reasons for lower effectiveness likely include both waning over time and the Delta variant.\", One US study showed vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization in adults 65 and older may have decreased, but only slightly, over time, she said. Unpublished CDC data shows vaccine effectiveness remains very high, at 94% or higher in adults 18 to 74, she said., , \"Preliminary VE against hospitalization in adults 75 years of age and older ... decreased in July but still remained over 80%,\" Oliver said., Vaccine efficacy has fallen from 75% at first to just over 50% among long term care facility residents, Oliver said. These were the first people vaccinated after the shots became available in December and January., \"The data we have seen today has demonstrated that Covid vaccines continue to maintain high protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death. Protection against infection, including asymptomatic and mild infection, appears to be lower in recent months,\" she said., All three companies making vaccines for the US market -- Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson -- are evaluating the effects of booster doses, she said. , The major questions are whether booster doses are safe and work to improve protection, she said., , \"Will booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines reduce Covid-19 incidence, hospitalization and/or mortality?\" she asked., ACIP will meet in the coming weeks to discuss data about vaccine efficacy in August, Oliver said. \"We will announce meetings as soon as we have dates,\" the CDC\'s Dr. Amanda Cohn said at the end of Monday\'s meeting., , , The CDC and FDA endorsed the use of boosters in certain immunocompromised people earlier this month. While the White House has pressed for booster doses to be offered more widely, the CDC and FDA are waiting for more information from the companies., But White House officials say they\'re looking at data from Israel as well as from the US, and want to be sure to be ahead of any changes in the pandemic. , On Monday, Israel started offering a booster to everyone 12 and older who had been vaccinated at least five months ago., Researchers in Israel reported Monday that people who chose to get a third dose of vaccine had a much lower risk of becoming infected, even as the more transmissible Delta variant swept across the country., , \"Conclusions: In conjunction with safety reports, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a third vaccine dose in both reducing transmission and severe disease and indicates the great potential of curtailing the Delta variant resurgence by administering booster shots,\" Yair Goldberg of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and colleagues wrote in their report, posted online by the Israeli government., The researchers noted that it is difficult to account for differences among people in a real-world study. People who choose to get a booster dose may be different from those who choose not to, and people behave differently after they\'ve received a shot., One major difference: recently vaccinated people are less likely to be tested for coronavirus infection, which means fewer infections would be detected in that group. Recently vaccinated people may also take more care to prevent infection.

Whether adolescents are struggling with the impact of Covid-19 on their lives or more ordinary issues around friends, grades, extracurriculars or graduation and what comes after, psychologist Lisa Damour offers clear prescriptions for parents. , Parents\' primary job, she said, is to help \"guard our kids against an overall sense of hopelessness.\" Easier said than done — these days, especially — but the stakes are too high not to try., Just as she does on her podcast, Ask Lisa: The Psychology of Parenting, with her Adolescence column for \"The New York Times\" and in her books, \"Untangled: Guiding Teenage Girls Through the Seven Transitions into Adulthood \" and \"Under Pressure: Confronting the Epidemic of Stress and Anxiety in Girls,\" Damour offers sane, science-backed perspectives on how parents can best help their teens and tweens through these tough times. , , This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity., , CNN: Protecting kids against hopelessness is no easy feat when we adults are struggling. What insights into the brains of teens and tweens can help parents in these moments?, Lisa Damour: Teenagers\' brains are neurologically gawky as they undergo an extraordinary remodeling process that makes the brain faster, more efficient and more powerful. This proceeds back-to-front, from the more primitive regions of the brain to the more sophisticated. , Because the emotions are housed in the more primitive regions, the capacity to feel things intensely gets upgraded before the ability to maintain perspective. By around age 13, if a teenager becomes upset, the activated emotion centers of the brain are sufficiently powerful that they can outmatch the reasoning frontal lobes and cause a real crashing emotional meltdown. , It\'s important for parents to remember that — given a little time, space and loving support — teens will usually reregulate on their own. When their frontal lobes come back online, their reasoning is excellent. Everybody\'s exhausted, everybody\'s tired. That hamstrings everybody\'s patience and perspective. Adults are neurologically advantaged here, so our job is to take very good care of ourselves so that we can provide the auxiliary support. , , , CNN: Youth depression and anxiety doubled during the pandemic. What do teens and tweens need right now to help them put into context the intensity of their emotions?, Damour: First, anxiety is only pathological when a person overestimates the danger they are in or underestimates their ability to manage it. If kids are feeling anxious about returning to school during a peak in Covid infections, rather than minimize their fears, we want to explore with them the actual level of danger and what control they have to mitigate it., My older daughter is vaccinated, will be expected to wear a mask at school, and has a decent amount of control over regulating the physical distance she keeps from others. , Talking through those precautions helps clarify her own ability to minimize risk. Identifying what we can control helps. Hopefully you can control enough variables to get the danger to a level that feels tolerable. But feeling anxious right now is not at all out of line or irrational., , CNN: You write that anxiety and stress offer gifts as well as discomfort, even in these extraordinary times. What benefits do these emotions bring?, Damour: Anxiety is an alarm system that alerts us to possible threats. That makes it an extraordinarily beneficial emotion. It\'s a gift handed down to us by evolution. Adults might experience it when somebody swerves in front of us while we\'re driving. A middle schooler might experience it if they haven\'t started studying for a big test. That is good, healthy feedback on what\'s going on around us and where or how we want to better position ourselves. , Stress is an absolute given in life. It occurs anytime we are adapting to new conditions, stretching beyond our established capacities. There\'s no growth in the absence of stress. , In fact, school is supposed to be stressful. We want kids to be doing work they find challenging. We only worry about stress if it overwhelms someone\'s coping capacity or if it is chronic and unrelenting, and there\'s no opportunity to recover and take a break and consolidate those gains. Weightlifters work out hard and then deliberately create time for muscle rest and repair. That recovery process is as essential to growth as any challenges we deliberately seek out or inevitably encounter. , , , CNN: How can parents know if their child has reached a point of problematic stress?, Damour: The weightlifting recovery metaphor helps us here again. If a young person has a chance to rest but things don\'t get better, there are probably grounds for concern. The analogy here is injury. If you have a tough workout at the gym then rest, you should feel good a couple of days later. But if you injure yourself, just resting for a couple of days won\'t fix the problem. Constructive stress comes from challenges that help us grow, not those that leave us incapacitated after the fact., , , CNN: How can a parent gauge the difference between an adolescent who\'s in recovery mode and one who\'s withdrawing out of unhealthy avoidance?, Damour: Avoidance is something that people of all ages instinctively want to do when they feel anxious or overwhelmed. Problematic avoidance will offer short-term relief but create long-term difficulty. We want to be on high alert for avoidance as the go-to strategy for managing distress, because it doesn\'t work, over time., The beautiful thing about teenagers is, we can ask them to reflect with us on how they\'re doing. A terrific first step for a worried parent is to say, \"I noticed you\'ve been sleeping a lot lately. Part of me is so glad to see you resting and recovering. Part of me is wondering if everything\'s okay. Is there anything that you are worried about or that I need to be thinking about?\"  , With that approach you\'re likely to recruit their mature side into the conversation. Our teenagers have two sides: their immature, impulsive, sometimes regressive side and their thoughtful, broad-minded, ambitious, self-protective side. The side that you speak to will be the side that shows up for the conversation., , CNN: You say parents need to worry about kids feeling alone with psychological pain — that, like all of us, kids need to feel seen. How can we do that?, Damour: Parents underestimate how powerful empathy is in terms of helping kids feel better. Too often we jump straight into problem-solving mode when they just want us to listen and say, \"Oh, that really stinks. I\'m so sorry.\" Either that\'s as much of a solution as they need, or they\'ll go figure out their own solution. The two most useful lines in all of parenting teenagers are: , Do you want my help, or do you just need to vent? And...Is there anything I can do that won\'t make this worse? , Those will usually cover your bases.

Now it\'s oxygen','Hospitals in parts of the South are running out of oxygen supply as Several hospitals in Florida, South Carolina, Texas and Louisiana are struggling with oxygen scarcity. Some are at risk of having to use their reserve supply or risk running out of oxygen imminently, according to state health officials and hospital consultants. , With the continued uptick in Covid-19 cases, there has been more demand on the oxygen supply, and hospitals cannot keep up the pace to meet those needs, Donna Cross, senior director of facilities and construction at Premier -- a health care performance improvement company -- told CNN. , \"Normally, an oxygen tank would be about 90% full, and the suppliers would let them get down to a refill level of 30-40% left in their tank, giving them a three- to five-day cushion of supply,\" said Cross. \"What\'s happening now is that hospitals are running down to about 10-20%, which is a one- to two-day supply on hand, before they\'re getting backfilled.\", Even when they\'re getting backfill, it\'s only a partial supply of about 50%, Cross said. \"It is very critical situation.\", Florida on Saturday had the highest Covid-19 hospitalization rate in the country, with 75 patients per 100,000 residents in hospitals with the virus, according to data from federal health officials and Johns Hopkins University. It also reached yet another pandemic high of Covid-19 cases Friday, reporting 690.5 new cases per 100,000 people each day from August 20 to August 26, state data showed. , Portable morgues for Central Florida, Covid-19 deaths have increased so much that the Central Florida Disaster Medical Coalition, a federally funded nonprofit that aids in preparing health care system response, has purchased 14 portable morgues with the capacity of 12 decedents each, coalition Executive Director Lynne Drawdy said. , She said that the organization has met with hospitals in the region to find out what their needs are. The hospitals relayed that in the last week more morgue space was the highest priority because there was not adequate capacity -- and that they have seen delays in funeral homes picking up those who have died. , Dr. Ahmed Elhaddad, an intensive care unit doctor in Florida, told CNN\'s Pamela Brown on Saturday that he\'s frustrated and \"tired of seeing people die and suffer because they did not take a vaccine.\" , He said the Delta variant is \"eating\" people\'s lungs, which eventually leads to their collapse. , \"We\'re seeing the patients die faster with this (Delta) variant,\" said Elhaddad, who is the ICU medical director at Jupiter Medical Center. , \"This round, we\'re seeing the younger patients -- 30-, 40-, 50-year-olds -- and they\'re suffering. They\'re hungry for oxygen, and they\'re dying. Unfortunately, this round they\'re dying faster,\" he said., The government\'s top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told CNN\'s Jake Tapper that the US could see an additional 100,000 deaths from Covid-19 by December, as predicted by a University of Washington model. , \"What is going on now is both entirely predictable, but entirely preventable. And you know we know we have the wherewithal with vaccines to turn this around,\" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said., Elhaddad noted that his ICU does not have a single Covid-19 patient who is vaccinated, nor did he see any vaccinated people die from Covid-19. , \"There\'s no magic medicine. ... The only thing that we\'re finding is that the vaccine is preventing death. It\'s preventing patients from coming to the ICU,\" Elhaddad said. , Fauci pointed to the 80 million Americans who are eligible for the vaccine, but who are not vaccinated. \"We could turn this around and we could do it efficiently and quickly if we just get those people vaccinated,\" he said., Florida has fully vaccinated 52.4% of its total population, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed Saturday. , Meanwhile, less than 50% of people in South Carolina, Louisiana and Texas -- where oxygen supplies are also low -- are fully vaccinated. Studies have shown that full vaccination is necessary for optimal protection against the Delta variant. , Nationally, 52.1% of the population was fully vaccinated as of Saturday, CDC data shows., Hurricane Ida targeting Louisiana as Covid-19 hospitalizations remain high , Louisiana\'s overall vaccination rate remains among the lowest in the nation at 41.2% -- and the state\'s hospitals are dealing with hundreds of Covid-19 patients as Hurricane Ida slams the region. , Some 2,450 people were hospitalized with Covid-19 in Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Saturday, which is a drop of 20% in the past 10 days. But it\'s still the most the state has had since before the current surge in cases, Edwards told CNN\'s Jim Acosta. , More than 475 of those patients are on ventilators, according to data from the state department of health., Hurricane Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, on Sunday as a dangerous Category 4 hurricane. Possible injuries from the storm stand to compound the risk of health care facilities being overwhelmed, given Covid-19 patients already occupy hospitals at high rates. , \"Evacuating hospitals is not going to be possible because there\'s nowhere to bring those patients to, there\'s no excess capacity anywhere else in the state or outside the state,\" Edwards said., \"Then you have people who may be injured as a result of the hurricane itself, and so we need to make sure we have some capacity for them,\" he said.  \"We still have a very, very challenging situation here across the state of Louisiana.\", Edwards pointed out that he\'s worried about lengthy power outages. The state has about 10,000 lineworkers ready to go and another 20,000 on standby to assist as soon as necessary. , \"Restoring power is going to be critically important in order to keep these hospitals up and functioning,\" he said.  , All of the state\'s parishes are in the highest risk category for coronavirus, with widespread, uncontrolled transmission, and many undetected cases, the state health department said., \'We\'re headed into a really tough time for young people,\' doctor says, A return to in-person learning has led to thousands of students having to quarantine across the US, with Covid-19 cases among children surging to levels not seen since winter., And hospitalizations of children due to Covid-19 could continue to increase as more of them return to classrooms this fall., \"There is no question that we\'re headed into a really tough time for young people,\" Dr. Esther Choo told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer on Saturday., Choo, a professor of emergency medicine at Oregon Health &amp; Science University, added that while people had some reassurance last year that the virus wouldn\'t affect children as severely, this year is different., \"We\'re going back to school in-person, unmasked across the United States.

Bergstrom, a biology professor at the University of Washington, in an email. Bergstrom co-teaches a course that trains students on how to evaluate the onslaught of information in their lives. \"Every year, a photograph of an adorable fuzzy rail chick goes viral as a picture of a \'baby crow.\' (Newly hatched crows are blind, featherless and look nothing like this).\" , An inaccurate story about wild animals might have limited repercussions, but misinformation about serious issues such as elections or the pandemic can be \"deeply damaging,\" affecting people\'s motivations, beliefs and decision-making regarding their health, politics, the environment and more, said Bergstrom, the coauthor of \"Calling Bullsh*t: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World.\", \"Sharing health misinformation and disinformation can get people killed,\" Bergstrom added. But \"what if I share misinformation about something like the Afghanistan withdrawal? It\'s not like sharing vaccine misinformation, in that my friends and family who read it aren\'t in any way involved in making decisions about US foreign policy.\", However, if we\'re flooded with false information about the Afghanistan withdrawal and other issues, we won\'t be able to collectively make the wise decisions we need to thrive as a society, Bergstrom said. , \"Second, misinformation often serves or even drives political polarization,\" he added. \"If we become convinced that half of our fellow Americans are irredeemably stupid, let alone evil, what does that do to our faith in the democratic process? I think it undermines this faith severely, and that is a grave threat to our society.\", The problem\'s exacerbated when family and friends share misinformation, because we tend to trust what they\'re saying is true without verifying it. Confronting loved ones about the falsity of their posts isn\'t easy, but if you\'re ready to speak up, here\'s how to handle it. , Understanding intentions , It\'s worth remembering that people who share misinformation may have good intentions. , Some false posts related to the pandemic may fall into this category, Bergstrom said. \"When we hear things around threats like this where there\'s a lot of uncertainty, it\'s very natural to try to get information and then share it with the people we care about to keep everybody safe.\",  Identifying false claims can be difficult since, misinformation usually contains elements of both truth and falsity, Bergstrom said. , That content, which people also may share to confirm their worldview, is sometimes \"viewed as equally credible to a trusted source,\" said Sam Vaghar, executive director of the Millennium Campus Network, a global student and alumni network aiding young people in addressing humanity\'s challenges. Vaghar is also part of the team behind the I\'m Making a Difference Instagram profile, which works with social media influencers to provide young adults with verified information about the pandemic. And sometimes misinformation blogs have been designed to look like news websites. , Approaching the situation, If someone\'s sharing high-stakes-misinformation, \"it\'s very tempting to want to shake them by the shoulders,\" said Joshua Coleman, a psychologist in private practice in Oakland, California, and a senior fellow with the Council on Contemporary Families, a nonprofit organization providing modern research about American families. But \"you really have to resist that temptation and keep communication in a more empathic place.\" , Being prepared with information from sources such as credible news outlets, the CDC, the World Health Organization or state health departments can help ensure your argument is more fact- or science-based than emotional or opinionated, Vaghar said. , Coleman advised avoiding a \"harsh startup,\" a phrase used by John Gottman, a marriage and divorce researcher and professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Washington., \"(Gottman) says that conversations end in the way they begin,\" Coleman said. \"You start a conversation out with hostility, anger, contempt or criticism; it\'s probably going to end that way.\", But the more you respectfully communicate, he added, \"the more likely people are going to lower their defenses and be interested in what we have to say.\" , Find ways to continually assert that you\'re not saying the person is foolish, and that if the stakes weren\'t so high you would agree to disagree or wouldn\'t say anything at all, Coleman suggested. Telling loved ones you\'re only bringing up the issue because you really care about them can communicate you\'re speaking from a mindset of love and concern. , Also be mindful of what your relationship with that person has been like, he suggested. Coleman said he might get into loud debates with certain friends, \"but at the core of it is the friendship, and we know that we\'re engaging in a semi-angry manner because we both care a lot about what we\'re speaking. We also know that once we\'re done with the conversation, no harm, no foul, whereas other people might experience that level of intensity or frustration in a much more hurtful way, and it will shut down the conversation.\" , If you suspect the person you\'re confronting is going to react defensively, you could say to them, \"I know a lot of people do think that\'s true, and I know there\'s a lot out there about that, so I could see how an intelligent person could conclude that\'s right. I don\'t know how much reading or investigating you\'ve been doing, and I\'ve actually been spending a lot of time reading or researching this topic. Do you care if I share with you what I\'m learning?\" Coleman suggested., This way, \"it\'s not like you\'re hitting them over the head\" with your opinion, Coleman said. , For people who have access to credible information but share misleading narratives they like, \"rather than responding with a list of facts, it can be more helpful to engage the underlying beliefs or perspectives that make this information attractive in the first place,\" Bergstrom said., \"If someone is afraid to take an FDA-approved COVID vaccine because they believe that government agencies cannot ever be trusted, listing statistics about vaccine safety won\'t get you very far.\" , Two things that might help are focusing on supporting evidence outside of the US regulatory system and sharing perspectives from others who share the person\'s beliefs about government but still advocate Covid-19 vaccination. , These approaches don\'t guarantee you\'re going to be persuasive, as people can cling to their strongly held beliefs, but they\'re good starts. , The truth about texting, and public vs. private confrontation , There are proper ways in which people should have these conversations, and texting isn\'t one of them, Coleman said. Since written communication lacks inflection, get on the phone so the person can hear any genuine care in your voice. , If you\'re concerned about whether to address a misleading social media post in a public comment or private message, doing both might be helpful., With a public comment, you might educate anyone \"vulnerable to the misinformation that\'s being perpetrated by the person,\" Coleman said. But there is a possibility that people posting could think you\'re humiliating them in front of their peers. , To prevent that, also send a private message saying you hope they don\'t mind you publicly sharing your thoughts, given the importance. , And what should you do if you confront someone about misinformation, and they acknowledge its falsity, but won\'t delete the post? Unfortunately, that person just might not care or could be leaving the post up as a reaction to criticism, Coleman said., Coleman is doubtful that a stranger will be responsive to a follow-up conversation. But if you know them, reiterating why you think the person shouldn\'t leave the post up might be worth another shot. And sharing any personal stake you have in this -- such as mentioning your experience being sick with Covid-19 to someone sharing pandemic-related misinformation -- \"can make it more compelling,\" he added. , If the person you confront is receptive to facts and your thoughts, that could foster a humanitarian perspective, in that we have shared purposes, sacrifices and fates, Coleman said.

Then the show was postponed because of the covid-19 pandemic. Pittman got sick with the coronavirus. He quit his job as a traffic engineer in Connecticut to relocate to St. Louis for his girlfriend — only to have her break up with him before he moved., But he still trekked from New England to Missouri in a converted minivan for the rescheduled outdoor show. \"Covid\'s been rough, and I\'m glad things are opening up again,\" he said., Yet hours before Pittman planned to cross off the concert from his bucket list, he learned the latest wrinkle: He needed proof of vaccination or a negative covid test from the previous 48 hours to enter the concert., The bands announced the requirements just two days earlier, sending some fans scrambling. It was the latest pivot by the concert industry, this time amid an increase in delta variant infections and lingering concerns about the recent Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago being a superspreader event. , After more than a year without live music, promoters, bands and fans are eager to keep the concerts going, but uncertainty remains over whether the vaccine or negative-test requirements actually make large concerts safe even if held outdoors., \"Absolutely not,\" said Dr. Tina Tan, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at Northwestern University. \"There is just too much covid that is circulating everywhere in the U.S.\", During the first months of summer, large outdoor venues such as Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado and Ruoff Music Center in Indiana again hosted bands such as the String Cheese Incident and Phish, with sellout crowds of mostly maskless people inhaling marijuana or whatever other particles were possibly around. , Then the delta variant surge in July prompted renewed concerns about large gatherings, even at such outdoor venues., Tan, and other doctors, warned that Lollapalooza, with an estimated 385,000 attendees from July 29 to Aug. 1, was a \"recipe for disaster\" even though organizers instituted a vaccine or negative-test requirement. , It turned out that Lollapalooza was not a superspreader event, at least according to Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady, who reported that only 203 attendees were diagnosed with covid. , Tan said she is skeptical of those numbers., \"We know that contact tracing on a good day is difficult, so think about a venue where you have hundreds of thousands of people,\" Tan said. \"That just makes contact tracing that much more difficult, and there always is a reluctance for people to say where they have been.\", But Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease expert at the University of Arizona, said she sees the Lollapalooza data as \"a really good sign.\" Still, an outdoor concert with the new entrance rules is not without risk, she said, particularly in states such as Missouri, where the delta variant has thrived.  , \"If you are considering an event in an area that has high or substantial transmission, it\'s probably not a great time for a large gathering,\" Popescu said. , Recently, two of the country\'s largest live music promoters, AEG Presents and Live Nation Entertainment, announced they would begin requiring vaccination cards or negative covid tests where permitted by law starting in October. But not all bands and venues are instituting such measures. And some simply are postponing shows yet again. For the second straight year, organizers canceled the annual New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival slated for October., Theresa Fuesting, 55, wasn\'t planning on coming to her first Wilco show, even though she had four tickets, until the bands announced the new rules. , \"I still think it\'s a threat even though I am vaccinated,\" said Fuesting, who lives just over the river from St. Louis in Illinois. , For promoters, ensuring that people like Fuesting feel safe enough to use their tickets affects their bottom line, said Patrick Hagin, who promoted the Wilco concert and serves as a managing partner of The Pageant and Delmar Hall music venues in St. Louis. Even if the tickets are already purchased, bar and merchandise sales at the venue suffer if fans are no-shows. , \"Also you worry: Is this person who purchased a ticket going to even come in the future?\" said Hagin., In non-covid times, more than 90% of ticket buyers ultimately attend, Hagin said. During the pandemic, that number has been as low as 60%. , Hagin said he is temporarily offering refunds for shows at his venues. St. Louis Music Park did not offer refunds for the Wilco concert and told fans on its Facebook page that it was instituting the requirements \"based on what each show wants.\" The venue operators did not answer questions for this story. , Jason Green, unable to get a refund for the Aug. 13 show, sold his two sixth-row tickets for $66 — which was $116 less than he paid for the pair in March 2020. He was concerned the venue\'s new requirements weren\'t enough., \"You want to wait and see if that\'s a legit thing that is keeping things from being spread,\" said Green, 42, who lives in St. Louis and is fully vaccinated against covid., He skipped the concert even though he and friends in a comic book collective liked Wilco enough to name a recent comic after the band\'s album \"A Ghost Is Born.\" The band enjoys a loyal local following: Tweedy is from Belleville, Illinois, just across the Mississippi River, and the band played its debut concert in 1994 in St. Louis., Fuesting and Pittman took their chances. , This was many fans\' first visit to the new venue, an open-air space beneath a curved roof. It was supposed to open last year but was delayed because of the pandemic. , Fans passed through metal detectors and quickly showed their vaccine cards or test results to people sitting at tables. Out of about 2,500 attendees, the venue had to turn only four people away; one of them left, got a test and then returned, Hagin said. , \"I was very encouraged just by how positive the compliance was,\" he said. , Fortunately, Pittman had a photo of his vaccine card on his phone, which organizers accepted., \"It was so much fun,\" said Fuesting, who wore a mask for the whole show. \"I just liked the energy of the crowd. They were all just such super fans and singing along to every song.\", The band encored with their classic tune \"Casino Queen,\" the name of a riverboat casino in East St. Louis, Illinois., \"Casino Queen,\" Tweedy sang, \"my lord, you\'re mean.\" , So is covid. But for Pittman, who didn\'t wear a mask, the show was worth the gamble. He said he was so into the music, he could push the coronavirus from his mind, at least for a bit., \"They just played all of my favorite songs, one after another,\" Pittman said. \"I wasn\'t even thinking about it.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/29/health/concerts-covid-khn-partner-wellness/index.html',1,211),(157,'CNN EXCLUSIVE \'Something has to be done\': After decades of near-silence from the CDC, the agency\'s director is speaking up about gun violence','For the first time in decades, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- the nation\'s top public health agency -- is speaking out forcefully about gun violence in America, calling it a \"serious public health threat.\" \"Something has to be done about this,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in an exclusive interview with CNN. \"Now is the time -- it\'s pedal to the metal time.\" , This summer alone has seen a spree of gun injuries and deaths, and the weekends have been especially violent, with an average of 200 people killed and 472 injured by guns each weekend in the United States, not including suicides, according to an analysis done by the Gun Violence Archive for CNN. That\'s nearly 3.4 people shot every hour every weekend. , \"The scope of the problem is just bigger than we\'re even hearing about, and when your heart wrenches every day you turn on the news, you\'re only hearing the tip of the iceberg,\" Walensky said. \"We haven\'t spent the time, energy and frankly the resources to understand this problem because it\'s been so divided.\" , The last sitting CDC director to make strong public statements about gun violence was Dr. David Satcher, who served in the position from 1993 to 1998.   , The National Rifle Association is a powerful lobbying force in Washington, and fearing Congressional budget cuts under NRA pressure, former CDC directors for decades were all but silent on gun violence, even as guns killed tens of thousands of Americans a year.  , Satcher said Walensky was brave for speaking out., \"This might mean -- could well mean -- taking some risks, so I salute Dr. Walensky,\" Satcher said. , The CDC\'s plan , In April, President Joe Biden said the country was facing \"a gun violence public health epidemic,\" but the CDC hasn\'t said how it plans to address the epidemic until now. , \"I swore to the President and to this country that I would protect your health. This is clearly one of those moments, one of those issues that is harming America\'s health,\" Walensky said. , Decades after lobbying pressure and politics all but stopped gun violence research, Walensky\'s plan is to restart that research and identify effective solutions.  , For example, the CDC is spending $2,224,482 to fund a surveillance mechanism that tracks, in nearly real time, the number of people coming into emergency rooms with nonfatal gunshot wounds. It collects data on the intent of the injury -- documenting, for example, whether it was self-inflicted, unintentional or related to an assault.  , \"We don\'t even know who enters the emergency department, in most places, as a result of firearm injury -- we don\'t even know it,\" Walesnky said. , The agency is also spending $8,085,935 on 18 research projects to prevent gun-related violence and injuries.  , In one of those projects, gun stores in Colorado have developed a suicide awareness program. So far in 2021, more than 15,700 people in the US have used a gun to end their own lives, according to the Gun Violence Archive. , Another project in Vermont educates children about how to safely use and store guns. According to a 2015 study, an estimated 7% of US children -- or 4.6 million, at the time -- lived with at least one loaded and unlocked gun., \"My job is to understand and evaluate the problem, to understand the scope of the problem, to understand why this happens and what are the things that can make it better - to research that, to scale that up, to evaluate it and to make sure that we can integrate it into communities,\" Walensky said. \"We have a lot of work to do in every single one of those areas because we haven\'t done a lot of work as a nation in almost any of them.\" , The CDC once did these kinds of studies -- until 1997, when the NRA convinced Congress to cut all of the CDC\'s funding for gun research, a loss equivalent to millions of dollars a year. , In 2018, then President Donald Trump signed a government spending bill that allowed the CDC to conduct gun violence research, and in 2020 and 2021 Congress agreed to millions of dollars for gun violence research for the first time in decades, allocating $25 million split between the CDC and the US National Institutes of Health.  , Walensky said much of CDC\'s research will be engaged in understanding the root causes of gun violence.   , \"Oftentimes these will be escalating events that occur that might lead to a suicide or a homicide, and what we really need to do is understand the root causes of that,\" she said. \"The firearm injury is probably the most distal part of what happens. It is the end event. What are the 10, 12, 15 things where we could have intervened before that singular event?\"   , A colleague\'s tragedy , Walensky is an infectious diseases specialist, but in 2012, she witnessed firsthand the grief caused by gun violence.  , At the time, she was a professor at Massachusetts General Hospital, where Dr. Chana Sacks was a resident. Sacks awoke on December 14 to learn that her cousin\'s son, Daniel Barden, had been shot at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Daniel, a first grader, died that day.   , \"There were months of looking at pictures of Daniel every day and then a year of reading every book, every study, all the data I could find on firearm-violence prevention,\" Sacks wrote in a 2015 essay in the New England Journal of Medicine.   , Determined to find a way to curb gun violence, Sacks turned to Walensky, one of her closest mentors.   , While mentors often direct young doctors to do research in well-funded specialties, Sacks says Walensky encouraged her to go into gun research, which was -- and still is -- politically charged and not very well funded.    , \"It was one step at a time, and Rochelle really helped me figure out each step, how I could find pathways to make this work,\" Sacks told CNN.  , Sacks went on to become co-founder and co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at Massachusetts General Hospital.   , \"This is inherently emotional work and Rochelle has helped me through a lot of tears,\" Sacks said. \"She saw that pain up close and there is no way to not be affected by it.\" , \'I\'m not here about gun control\'  , In restarting gun violence research, Walensky said she wants the CDC to find common ground with gun owners.  , \"Let\'s agree, we don\'t want people to die. Let\'s just agree there. What can we do to stop people from dying, and what can we do to stop people from being injured,\" she said.   , Walensky seems careful to avoid the ire of gun rights activists -- she doesn\'t even like using the word \"gun,\" preferring the term \"firearm.\" , \"Generally, the word gun, for those who are worried about research in this area, is followed by the word control, and that\'s not what I want to do here,\" she added. \"I\'m not here about gun control. I\'m here about preventing gun violence and gun death.\"       , She said she doesn\'t want people to think she is trying to take away their guns.  , \"This is not a conversation about having them or not having them. This is a conversation about how we can make them being here safe,\" she said. \"The research that we intend to do is going to be squarely about making America safe. Making people safe.\" , She invited gun owners to be part of the solution.   , \"Come to the table. Join us in the conversation,\" she said. \"I want you to teach me what you have done to make your gun safe, and then I want you to teach everybody else,\" she added.     , \"We cannot understand the research of firearm violence, firearm injury, without embracing wholeheartedly, the firearm owning community,\" she added.  \"I really do believe that the population of people who wants to own a gun doesn\'t want people hurt by them. The majority of the population does not want people hurt by them. I want them at the table.\" , CNN reached out to the NRA to ask if it was willing to work with Walensky. A spokesperson for the NRA did not respond to CNN\'s request for comment.  , When gun owners hear that the CDC wants to reduce gun violence, they\'ll think that the government wants to take away their guns, said Dr. Chris Barsotti, an emergency physician and gun owner who teaches children in the firearm education program in Vermont.   , \"They\'re going to think this is another political approach to make it difficult to access guns or potentially confiscate guns or create barriers to access,\" Barsotti said., Barsotti and other gun owners say there are committed to reducing gun violence. He is the founding CEO of the American Foundation for Firearm Injury Reduction in Medicine., The NRA\'s next steps , By speaking up, Walenksy risks enraging the NRA. , If the gun lobby again pressures Congress to cut CDC gun research funding, it\'s unclear if lawmakers will acquiesce as they did in 1997.  , Andrew McGuire, who\'s been involved in gun control advocacy for more than 30 years, said the NRA may no longer have the political power it once did, given that the group tried to file for bankruptcy and New York Attorney General Letitia James has charged the NRA with illegal conduct and filed a lawsuit to dissolve them.  , In a letter to its members, the NRA pushed back against the charges, saying the NRA was \"committed to good governance\" and that it \"complies with board policies and accounting controls, (has) displaced \'insiders\' who abused the Association, and accepted reimbursements for costs voluntarily determined to be excess benefits.\" , \"Is the NRA down and out enough that they can\'t muster an all-out assault on the CDC? Or is that totally crazy thinking because the NRA can always muster any assault at any time?\" said McGuire, executive director of the Trauma Foundation, an injury prevention organization.  , Even if the NRA does mount an all-out war against the CDC, it\'s not clear that Republican members of Congress will respond as obediently as they did 25 years ago, McGuire added.   ,  \"Are members of Congress who have been in their grip thinking of the NRA as a wounded animal and so maybe aren\'t in their grip anymore?\" he said.   , While Walensky said she worries that just saying the word guns or talking about firearms could anger many Americans, she said she\'s committing to pursing the gun violence research.  , \"I also worry that if we don\'t do anything about it, we have a whole sector of the United States that gets really angry,\" she said. \"This is one of the leading killers of our young people in this country. It\'s a high priority.\"  , Sacks, her former colleague in Boston, said Walensky is a determined person.   , \"If you\'ve spoken to Rochelle for ten minutes, you know that when she focuses on something with intensity, it\'s going to happen,\" she said.

This is actually a situation that is happening in Alabama hospitals now,\" Harris said. , \"We have enough people dying ... that there is no room to put these bodies,\" he added. \"We are really in a crisis situation. ... I don\'t know how much longer we\'re going to be able to do this.\", Alabama reported 50 Covid-19 related deaths Thursday and saw \"double digit numbers of deaths\" in the past two to three weeks, Harris said. , At least 5,571 Alabama children tested positive for Covid-19 last week, Harris said Friday, noting that officials aren\'t sure where the children contracted the virus. The state currently has a 23% Covid-19 positivity rate, among the highest in the nation, Harris said. , Alabama is seeing a surge in pediatric cases from last year, Harris explained. Of the 2,879 people hospitalized with Covid-19 on Thursday, 45 of them are children, with at least five of them on ventilators, Harris said. , , Louisiana hospitals won\'t evacuate ahead of Ida, As Hurricane Ida approaches the Gulf Coast, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a Saturday briefing there are 2,450 patients currently hospitalized with Covid-19 across the state, which is a drop of 20% in the past 10 days. , \"That\'s very helpful going into this hurricane, especially since we know that the evacuation of our hospitals is not an option,\" said Edwards., , More than 475 of those patients are on ventilators, according to data from the state department of health., Edwards told CNN\'s Jim Acosta the hospitals have been stocking up on supplies and testing their generators ahead of the storm. FEMA has also brought in additional generators for the hospitals, he added., \"It\'s going to be a real challenge and we\'re likely to need some help with respect to our hospitals,\" the governor said. \"And then you have the people who may be injured as a result of the hurricane itself and so we need to make sure we have some capacity for them.\", All of the state\'s parishes are in the highest risk category for coronavirus, with widespread, uncontrolled transmission and many undetected cases, the state health department said., Oxygen supplies running low in the South, As many hospitals across the country face a shortage of available beds and staff, there\'s another concern in the South: a shortage of oxygen., According to state health officials and hospital consultants, there are several hospitals across Florida, South Carolina, Texas and Louisiana that have experienced oxygen shortages, with some at risk of moving to their reserve supply or even running out of oxygen., \"As Covid has continued to evolve, we have continued to see Covid care best practices continue to evolve, and that in part has been the use of high-flow oxygen versus ventilators,\" said Donna Cross, senior director of facilities and construction at Premier, a health care performance improvement company., Cross told CNN that the spike in Covid-19 cases has caused more demand on the oxygen supply and hospitals cannot keep the pace., Coronavirus transmission is high across the country, All 50 states have high rates of Covid-19 transmission, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday, as millions of children who are unable to be vaccinated return to school. The CDC identifies virus transmission to be high when the total new cases per 100,000 people in a 7-day period is 100 cases or more. , But only half of US states -- plus Washington, DC, -- have fully vaccinated at least 50% of their residents. Those states include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington state and Wisconsin., Across the country, roughly 32% of people ages 12 to 17 fully vaccinated, adolescents have been tough to vaccinate, but there are some highlights.  , More than 86% of those ages 12 to 17 who received a first dose would later complete their vaccinations, which is necessary for optimal protection against the Delta variant, according to a CDC study.  , The study stresses the importance of vaccinating eligible children and young people as schools return. , \"Improving vaccination coverage and implementing Covid-19 prevention strategies are crucial to reduce Covid-19-associated morbidity and mortality among adolescents and to facilitate safer reopening of schools for in-person learning,\" researchers wrote in the study. , , Covid-19 is hitting school staff and students, Back-to-school season has been devastating to some states and districts that are seeing a distressing number of students contract the virus. Preventative measures such as quarantining are happening nationwide., In Mississippi, 28,990 students were quarantined between August 16 and 20 after possible exposure to Covid-19, according to data from the state\'s department of health, up from the 20,334 students who quarantined from August 9 to 13. , It\'s unclear how many of those are new student quarantines, or students who have had to remain quarantined from the prior week. Schools report numbers, not the names, of those quarantined, according to the department of health. , A total of 11,766 students and 2,383 employees have tested positive for Covid-19 in Mississippi schools since the beginning of August when schools began, health officials said., , In California, the Los Angeles Unified School District reported 2,847 active Covid-19 cases among students and staff across all as of Friday evening, according to the district\'s dashboard. The district said that as of Tuesday, 3,000 students and 500 employees were required to isolate at home while 3,500 students and 500 employees had to quarantine at home. , The second largest district in the country enacted some of the strongest mitigation measures throughout its more than 1,000 schools. But officials remain on guard about the spread. , \"We anticipate an upward trend in outbreaks as our schools have reopened, but we\'re continuing to work hard to prevent, investigate and manage them as they happen,\" Los Angeles County Public Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer said during a weekly briefing on Thursday., ,  , Health care resources are stretched thin for non-Covid-19 patients , As increases in Covid-19 cases persist, medical attention for other health needs is being curtailed. , Three OhioHealth hospitals decided to temporarily pause elective surgeries that require an overnight stay due to an influx of Covid-19 hospitalizations, spokesperson Colin Yoder told CNN in a statement Friday. The move, effective Monday, frees hospital capacity and staff, he explained. , \"Due to the fluid nature of this fourth surge, we will continually monitor capacity and pause or resume elective surgeries with an overnight stay as needed,\" Yoder said., , , Difficulties in maintaining a high level of health care are not limited to staffing issues. There has also been a shortage in the monoclonal antibody treatment used to treat both hospitalized Covid-19 patients and those with serious chronic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis., The treatment Actemra was granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration in June to treat those with Covid-19. The medication reduces inflammation that can make patients sicker. It is regularly used for those with rheumatoid arthritis, yet Genentech, the company that makes Actemra, doesn\'t have enough for everyone who needs it. , Last week, the company said demand for the drug went up more than 400% beyond pre-Covid-19 levels, in a span of two weeks. Supplies of several dose levels of the medicine have been out of stock in the US since last Monday., On Thursday, Genentech told customers it\'s \"working as urgently as possible to expedite replenishments and increase manufacturing capacity and supply wherever possible.\"  , The company said the medicine should be available for distribution starting Monday, but \"given continued tight supply, Genentech anticipates additional intermittent periods of stockouts in the months ahead if the pandemic continues at the current pace.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/28/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html',1,213),(159,'What\'s the risk of indoor dining if you\'re fully vaccinated? Here\'s what one expert says','With Covid-19 infections at their highest levels since January and hospitalizations at a level not seen since the winter surge, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention There are many people who are fully vaccinated and want to be responsible members of society. They are wondering, what can and should they continue to do? What about getting together with friends, dining indoors, and going to the gym? Can vaccinated grandparents still get together with their unvaccinated grandchildren?, To help answer these questions, we spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She\'s also author of a new book, \"Lifelines: A Doctor\'s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.\", , CNN: How should people be thinking differently about risk given the rise in infections and new research?  , Dr. Leana Wen: In terms of processing where we are right now, I think people should keep two things in mind. First, most parts of the United States have substantial or high Covid-19 transmission, as defined by the CDC. We need to think about the vaccine as a very good raincoat. If it\'s drizzling outside — if the level of infection isn\'t very high — the vaccines will protect very well. But if it\'s a constant thunderstorm, then there\'s a higher chance of getting wet. A vaccinated person is at higher risk when surrounded by a lot of people who could be infected with Covid-19, and that\'s what occurring throughout the US right now., Second, we are entering a phase in the pandemic where nearly all activities will have some level of risk. People need to decide for themselves what risk they are comfortable with by considering their household\'s medical circumstances and the value of the activity to them. , If everyone in your household is fully vaccinated and generally healthy, you might be willing to take on more risk. You might conclude that even if a breakthrough infection were to happen, it would probably be mild, and you are OK with taking on that risk in order to continue your pre-pandemic activities. Someone else could decide that, because they live at home with unvaccinated younger children or immunocompromised family members, they want to be more cautious., I think that both options are equally reasonable. The vast majority of the spread of Covid-19 is by people who are unvaccinated. Vaccinated people are not a threat to public health, and they should be able to exercise their own judgment about what activities are safe enough for them., , CNN: Let\'s go through the risk of specific activities. What\'s the risk of indoor dining?, Wen: Indoor dining in a restaurant definitely has more risk than dining outdoors. What that risk is depends on several factors. For starters, what\'s the space configuration in the restaurant? A very crowded, poorly ventilated setting will have higher risk than a venue in which you could spread out from other diners., Also, who are you dining with? If everyone in your party is known to be fully vaccinated, and these are the only people who will be near you, that is a safer scenario than if members of your own party are unvaccinated. I\'d also look at the rate of virus transmission in your community. The lower the rate, the potentially safer it is., CNN: How about going to the gym?, Wen: Again, that depends on the circumstances. If you\'re using the elliptical or weight machines, and no one is close to you, then it\'s pretty safe. If you\'re attending outdoor gym classes, the risk is also low. But if you\'re going to, say, a high intensity exercise class where a lot of people are breathing heavily, near one another, and you don\'t know whether they are vaccinated, the risk is substantially higher., CNN: Would you travel?, Wen: The risk of air travel is pretty low and can be reduced further if you are wearing a high-quality mask like an N95 or KN95. The bigger concern is what happens once you get to your destination, as I addressed in this CNN Q&amp;A., , CNN: What about a private gathering with friends where everyone is vaccinated? Would it be OK to continue dinner parties and other indoor get-togethers? , Wen: That will certainly be a lot lower risk than if the same people were together, but they were unvaccinated. A CDC study this week found that those who are unvaccinated have five times the rate of getting Covid-19 than the vaccinated (and a 29-times higher likelihood of being hospitalized or dying from coronavirus). , A lot of vaccinated people would feel comfortable with the level of risk in this situation. Again, it\'s not zero, but it\'s fairly low. That\'s particularly true if the other people at the gathering have a similar level of risk tolerance to you and are otherwise not engaging in high-risk activities — for example, if they always wear masks when in indoor public spaces and if they avoid higher-risk exposures such as crowded bars and restaurants., CNN: Last fall and winter, people formed pandemic pods. Would you recommend doing this again?, Wen: For some people, yes, I would. There are many people who really want to minimize the chance of having a breakthrough infection. That includes individuals who have underlying medical conditions, where a breakthrough infection that\'s mild for someone else could land them in the hospital. Others might be pretty healthy themselves, but don\'t want to be asymptomatic carriers who could transmit Covid-19 to their vulnerable family members. People in similar situations, who have a similar approach when it comes to caution in their lives, could decide to form a pandemic pod with one another. They could decide to socialize only others in the same pod indoors., My family has done this with another family that has young, unvaccinated children. That makes childcare, carpooling and playdates easier. I\'d also advise others to consider the level of caution other households have before deciding to get together indoors with them. When in doubt, get together outdoors only., , CNN: Can vaccinated grandparents still be getting together with their unvaccinated grandchildren?, Wen:  Yes. I\'d advise grandparents who are concerned about transmitting Covid-19 to their unvaccinated grandchildren can choose to reduce their own risk in the three to five days prior to seeing their grandkids. They could refrain from indoor get-togethers with others during this period, and, if they want to be extra safe, I\'d suggest that they get tested just before seeing their grandkids. , , , , My advice is the same the other way around, for the grandkids, if grandparents are particularly vulnerable. The grandkids can always make sure to wear masks indoors around others in the three to five days prior to getting together and then getting tested before the reunion., If all of this is too much, consider seeing one another outdoors only. Outdoors remains much safer than indoors. And, of course, if there are any individuals age 12 and above who are not yet vaccinated, they should do so as soon as possible, to protect them and others around them.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/28/health/vaccine-safe-activities-dr-wen-wellness/index.html',1,214),(160,'US Surgeon General urges parents and officials take these steps to protect children from Covid-19','A return to in-person learning has led to thousands of students having to quarantine across the US, with \"If they are around people who are vaccinated, everyone in the household gets vaccinated, that significantly reduces the risk to our children,\" Dr. Vivek Murthy said in a conversation hosted by the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation. , In the classroom, there are layers of protection that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has laid out to keep children safe -- including wearing properly fitting masks, properly ventilating buildings and regular testing, Murthy said., \"Even though our kids do better, that doesn\'t mean that Covid is benign, it doesn\'t mean that it\'s harmless in our children,\" Murthy said. \"In fact, we\'ve lost hundreds of children to Covid-19.\", The misperception that young people don\'t have to worry about Covid-19 may also be hindering their motivation to get vaccinated, Murthy said., As of Saturday, teens ages 16 and 17 had the highest rate of infection among all age groups, according to a CNN analysis of data from the CDC. Cases overall have surged across the US, with the daily average of newly reported infections surpassing 155,000., Vaccination is key to protecting against Covid-19 and the serious illness that could come with it. But for many children, vaccination still isn\'t an option., Pfizer/BioNTech\'s vaccine has been fully approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, but only for those 16 and older, and emergency use authorizations only extend to children as young as 12. , Children ages 5 to 11 are the next group in line to become eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine, and an updated emergency use authorization from the FDA would make at least 28 million additional children, but the process of authorizing a vaccine may not come until the end of the year, Murthy told CNN\'s Briana Keilar earlier this week., In the meantime, Murthy stressed that \"there are steps we can take to keep our kids safer. It\'s all the more important with Delta.\", Students sent back into quarantine, The stress over safety precautions in schools is growing, as many students have already faced exposure to Covid-19 in the early days of their new school year., At least 14,746 students and 2,984 employees have tested positive for Covid-19 throughout the 15 largest school districts in Florida since the start of school, according to a CNN analysis. , Several districts in the state have been at odds with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over mask mandates in the classroom after the governor banned such measures and some districts chose to implement them anyway. A judge on Friday ruled against DeSantis, saying he did not have the authority to prevent local measures., In Georgia, six schools in Henry County are temporarily conducting remote learning through August 27 due to \"a consistent increase in the number of the individuals required to quarantine.\", With the start of school fast approaching for New York City, officials there announced a change to last year\'s quarantine policy based on vaccinations., City Department of Education Chancellor Meisha Ross Porter and Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that only unvaccinated students will be subject to quarantine if exposed to positive cases, \"This is crucial to remember -- anyone vaccinated who is not symptomatic, adult or child, even if there\'s been contact, they\'re going to stay in school,\" de Blasio said Thursday. \"I don\'t want people thinking of last year\'s model and assuming everything\'s the same now. It\'s not the same. Why? Because of vaccination.\", Hospitals  stretched thin as ICU beds run out, The rise in cases has overwhelmed many health care workers trying to keep up with the more than 100,000 Americans hospitalized with Covid-19., In Georgia, many hospitals have requested ambulance transports be sent to other facilities because they\'re stretched thin. The Georgia Department of Public Health on Thursday asked residents to help reduce the strain on EMS and emergency departments by getting vaccinated, wearing a mask and getting tested for Covid-19 somewhere other than the state\'s hospitals., And in Illinois, ICU beds are running out, particularly in southern Illinois and parts of central Illinois, Illinois Department of Public Health Dr. Ngozi Ezike said., Nearly all of the people hospitalized with Covid-19 are unvaccinated, Gov. J. B. Pritzker said Thursday, and those hospitalizations have \"multiplied\" the state\'s ICU usage \"by a factor of seven this summer.\", Kentucky has also seen a steep increase in hospitalizations. On July 14, 239 people were hospitalized with Covid-19 -- on Wednesday that number had grown to 2,074, marking 42 straight days of increases, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday., Some states are calling for reinforcements to support staffing at overwhelmed hospitals., The Texas Department of State Health Services will deploy 2,500 additional medical staff to support health care facilities in the state, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced. Medical equipment such as ventilators, oxygen concentrators, heart monitors, IV pumps, feeding pumps, and hospital beds will also be provided. , In Nebraska, the shortage of nurses and spike in hospitalizations has prompted Gov. Pete Ricketts to declare a hospital staffing emergency. Ricketts announced two new measures to help address the personal strain: making it easier for health care professionals to defer continuing education or licensing requirements and limiting elective surgeries., By limiting elective surgeries across the state, Ricketts hopes \"to help free up hospital capacity, to take on some of the other patients that are coming into the hospital, both non-Covid and Covid patients,\" he added. , Health departments get death threats, West Virginia governor says, West Virginia Governor Jim Justice said health departments are getting death threats over local mask mandates., During a Friday briefing, Justice said people blame the health departments for mask mandates in schools, but clarified that those decisions have been left up to the local boards of education and superintendents., \"You know, I mean, do we really need to get to this? I mean, this is an absolute shame and surely to God above, we\'ll stop threatening the very men and women that work so hard to save our lives,\" Justice said., Justice reiterated that he is not an advocate of mandates or masks, but repeatedly encouraged everyone to get vaccinated. , West Virginia is reporting 1,328 new cases of Covid-19 with 547 Covid-19 patients  hospitalized and 178 people in the ICU, Justice said.

The teacher assumed the symptoms indicated allergies, not infection, the investigators found.,  In the classroom of 22 students, 12 became infected -- including eight out of 10 students in the two front rows., , And that\'s despite layers of measures intended to prevent transmission of the virus., \"The school required teachers and students to mask while indoors; interviews with parents of infected students suggested that students\' adherence to masking and distancing guidelines in line with CDC recommendations was high in class. However, the teacher was reportedly unmasked on occasions when reading aloud in class,\" the report read., \"Throughout this period, all desks were separated by six feet,\" it added. \"All classrooms had portable high-efficiency particulate air filters and doors and windows were left open.\", It wasn\'t enough to protect the kids., Eventually, 27 people, including the teacher, were infected. None were seriously ill and all recovered. Those cases that were analyzed involved the Delta variant of coronavirus, although the researchers said they were not necessarily able to test everyone who may have been infected in the outbreak., The CDC highlighted the case as an example of how schools need to follow all recommendations if they want to protect students and staff., , \"The introduction of the virus into the classroom by a teacher who worked in school, while she was both symptomatic and unvaccinated and who was unmasked when reading aloud to a class, resulted in cases within the classroom, across the school and among families of students and staff in the community,\" Walensky told a White House Covid-19 briefing Friday. , \"We know how to protect our kids in school. We have the tools.\", The CDC\'s guidance for schools lists vaccination as the No. 1 way to protect everyone. \"Vaccination is the leading public health prevention strategy to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Promoting vaccination can help schools safely return to in-person learning as well as extracurricular activities and sports,\" it says., Kids under 12 are not eligible for vaccination, and the CDC says it\'s important for the adults around them to get vaccinated to protect them., Dr. Lisa Santora, deputy health officer for the county, said officials there had been urging teachers to be vaccinated since January, but many had not done it. \"We saw firsthand that it wasn\'t kids who were going to get teachers sick. It was going to be the reverse,\" Santora told CNN., Santora said Marin County had organized \"Super Saturday\" events to encourage teachers and staff to get vaccinated, but some teachers still remain unvaccinated. \"Adults are underestimating their risk of hospitalization when they are choosing not to get vaccinated,\" she told CNN., She said 90% of people in hospitals with Covid-19 in the county right now are unvaccinated -- and many are between the ages of 30 and 50., The outbreak at the elementary school was a heads up to the county that the Delta variant was going to make it harder to prevent outbreaks, she said., \"We had a few of the adults who were part of the outbreak -- they were parents of children in school -- they were vaccinated. That was another indication to us that Delta was different,\" she said., \"Among the five infected adults, one parent and the teacher were unvaccinated; the others were fully vaccinated,\" the report reads. \"The vaccinated adults and one unvaccinated adult were symptomatic with fever, chills, cough, headache, and loss of smell. No other school staff members reported becoming ill.\", The county was able to conduct an intensive contact tracing operation that painted a good picture of what happened. Several children appeared to have been infected during a sleepover, and some from the infected teacher\'s class appear to have infected siblings., Testing of most of the children who were exposed was key, because many of the children never developed symptoms., \"The school was on point with all of their mitigation strategies,\" Santora said. \"I think if it wasn\'t Delta, I don\'t think we would have seen this.\", Nonetheless, the CDC concluded, schools can safely open for in person classes if they take care.,  Los Angeles County officials studied cases in their schools from September to March. They counted 463 cases among students in that time that could be linked back to a school exposure, and 3,927 among staff who were back in person.  This was a far lower case rate than in the community at large during the same period, they reported., \"In schools with safety protocols in place for prevention and containment, case rates in children and adolescents were 3.4 times lower during the winter peak compared with rates in the community,\" they wrote. , \"This analysis reflects transmission patterns before the more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant became predominant in the United States. A multipronged prevention strategy, including masking, physical distancing, testing, and most recently vaccination of children and adolescents aged 12 years and above, will remain critical to reducing transmission as more students return to the classroom,\" they added., \"These findings from a large and diverse county present preliminary evidence that schools provided a relatively safe environment during the 2020-21 school year.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/27/health/teacher-covid-students/index.html',1,217),(162,'CDC warns against use of anti-parasitic drug ivermectin for Covid-19, as calls to poison control centers increase ','The The CDC also cautions about an increase in reports of severe illness caused by the drug to poison centers., , Ivermectin is used to treat parasites such as worms and lice in humans and it is also used by veterinarians to de-worm large animals. , For months, conservative media -- including Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Laura Ingraham -- have talked about how it could be used to treat Covid-19. It\'s a popular topic on Twitter. Ivermectin has been called a \"miracle drug\" in congressional hearings. Even Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson has been touting its benefit to treat Covid-19 cure., , Normally, about 3,600 prescriptions are written for ivermectin in a week, the CDC said. This rose more than tenfold by the week of January 8, when 39,000 prescriptions were written. \"Since early July 2021, outpatient ivermectin dispensing has again begun to rapidly increase, reaching more than 88,000 prescriptions in the week ending August 13, 2021. This represents a 24-fold increase from the pre-pandemic baseline,\" the CDC said., GoodRx a company that tracks drug prices has seen a similar sharp increase in prescriptions filled for ivemectin. From the company\'s data for August, so far they\'ve seen 20 times the average level of fills in 2019., The US Food and Drug Administration has cautioned people against using ivermectin to treat Covid-19. Last Saturday the FDA tweeted: \"You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y\'all. Stop it.\", Calls to poison control centers have increased three-fold, compared to the number of calls about the drug before the pandemic, the CDC said. , , Some examples of these calls included an adult who wanted to prevent Covid-19 and had to be hospitalized for nine days after drinking a cattle formula. Another person who bought pills online to treat their Covid-19 infection was hospitalized after taking five tablets a day for five days., The CDC reminded doctors that ivermectin is not authorized or approved for use in Covid-19 patients. Doctors did investigate the possibility, but clinical trials of the drug \"yielded insufficient evidence\" to treat Covid-19. Scientists would need to perform more clinical trials to see if it actually worked to treat the disease. Overdoses of the drug can cause stomach problems, nerve damage, seizures, disorientation, coma and death. , , The CDC advisory reminded the public that vaccination rather than treatment \"is the safest and most effective way to prevent getting sick and protect against severe disease and death\" from Covid-19.

She\'s immunocompromised and susceptible to getting really sick if she caught Covid-19. She has lupus and rheumatoid arthritis and it is these diseases that add an extra layer to her frustration and anger., To keep her rheumatoid arthritis symptoms under control, to be able to function every day, once a month she gets an infusion of a biologic called Actemra, also known as tocilizumab. But now, because of the pandemic and the recent surge in cases, there is no Actemra available, \"We did our part to preserve ourselves, our community, in trying to help battle this by getting vaccinated,\" Melendez said. \"It\'s just unfortunate that the ignorance and laziness, for lack of better words, of other people who avoided taking the vaccine and ended up in the hospital with Covid, now has to impact me.\", Repurposing drugs to treat Covid-19, In June, the US Food and Drug Administration gave Actemra an emergency use authorization to treat hospitalized Covid-19 patients. This monoclonal antibody can reduce inflammation that can make patients sicker., The antibody treatment blocks an inflammatory protein called IL-6 that causes damage in rheumatoid arthritis. That same protein plays a role in some of the serious symptoms in people with severe Covid-19 infections., The latest surge in cases caused a global shortage. Genentech, the company that makes Actemra, doesn\'t have enough for everyone who needs it. Last week, the company said demand for the drug went up more than 400% beyond pre-Covid levels in just two weeks., In the United States, supplies of several dose levels of this medicine have been out of stock since last Monday. , A life saver and life changer, For patients with Covid-19, the drug can be lifesaving. For patients with rheumatoid arthritis, like Melendez, it can be life-altering. , \"It has restored my ability to have a fully functioning life,\" Melendez said. \"Before it, it was so bad that simple things like brushing my teeth, combing my hair, opening a bottle of water, unfastening a pair of jeans, going to a restaurant,  feeding myself were all challenges. Standing up and walking was hard. That\'s how bad my RA gets and I\'m only 47.\" , Without the medication, even for a month, people can suffer debilitating flare-ups.  , , \"There are thousands of patients who take monthly Actemra to help their inflammatory diseases,\" said Dr. Marcus Snow, chair of the committee on Rheumatic Care at the American College of Rheumatology, who works at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. \"The people who need these medicines have been through significant trials and tribulations to get to the point where they need these medicines, and to all of a sudden have a shortage is terrifying for a lot of people.\" , Steven Taylor, the executive vice president of mission and strategic initiatives for the Arthritis Foundation, said that while there are other drugs available, they aren\'t easily interchangeable. , \"It isn\'t easy to switch drugs, especially when you\'re on a serious drug like Actemra,\" Taylor said. \"You surely don\'t want to be bouncing around.\", The American College of Rheumatology said it has received \"a number\" of emails from concerned members. The organization sent out a notice about the shortage last week, as did the Arthritis Foundation. , Genetech is expanding manufacturing, On Thursday, Genentech sent a notice to customers saying it was \"working as urgently as possible to expedite replenishments and increase manufacturing capacity and supply wherever possible.\"  , The company said the medicine should be available for distribution starting Monday, August 30, but \"given continued tight supply, Genentech anticipates additional intermittent periods of stockouts in the months ahead if the pandemic continues at the current pace.\", A subcutaneous injectible form of Actemra that has not been authorized to treat Covid-19 is still available for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Snow suggested patients ask their doctors about it. It\'s unclear if insurance would cover it., And for hospitalized Covid-19 patients, there are some alternatives if Actemra is not available., The World Health Organization recommended in June that Actemra be used to treat Covid-19 patients. Worried for them now, it has called for Roche, the parent company of Genetech, to ensure there was equitable allocation of current stocks for all countries. , \"We also strongly encourage Roche to facilitate technology transfer and knowledge and data sharing to broaden access to this important treatment,\" the WHO said in its statement., Roche, Genentech\'s parent company, said it would not enforce its patents in low- and middle-income countries during the pandemic so more companies can make the medicine. Doctors Without Borders complained this was not enough. It had argued the drug is \"inaccessible and unaffordable for the majority of the world.\", More pandemic shortages , This is not the first shortage in the pandemic. Supply chains were disrupted when factories had to shut down to prevent the spread of the virus, and Covid-19 put a real demand shock on top of a system that was already fragile, according to Erin Fox, an expert on drug shortages who works as a senior director, drug information and support services at University of Utah Health., \"All it takes is a little spike in demand and we have problems,\" Fox said. , Because of the uncertainty of surges, some facilities also hoarded some medication. Genentech recently said it would not take orders back, and that should cut down on hoarding, Fox said., The way pharmaceutical companies typically operate can also cause problems, according to Michael Ganio, the senior director of pharmacy practice and quality at American Society of Health System Pharmacists. , \"The same as any other manufacturer, they\'re going to make enough for what they think they need for the year. Nobody wants to have extra inventory sitting around,\" Ganio said. , Ganio said the American Society of Health System Pharmacists has also heard reports of shortages of in-line filters that are used with IV bags. There\'s been more demand for them due to the increasing use of the Regeneron antibody cocktail used to treat people with Covid-19., Some electrolyte products have also been in chronic shortage, he said. , Even before the pandemic, drug shortages have been considered a \"real challenge for public health\" according to the FDA, and it\'s been going on for decades. , There are currently at least 110 drugs in shortage according to the FDA. The American Society of Health System Pharmacists counts 183.  , \"It\'s very frustrating. In shortage after shortage after shortage the manufacturer does not have a plan for when they can\'t supply product. It\'s often \'good luck, we\'re out,\' \" Fox said. \"All decisions are made about the business first and unfortunately, there\'s no requirement to make anything, no matter how life saving it is.\" , In its 2020 report to congress, the FDA said that it is \"doing everything within its authority to help prevent and alleviate\" disruptions and shortages and worked with manufacturers to prevent 199 shortages, but for now that doesn\'t help patients like Melendez., \"I know I can\'t be the only person who\'s sitting here today on edge,\" Melendez said. \"I want to make sure they don\'t forget about us.\" , ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/27/health/actemra-shortage-rheumatoid-arthritis-covid/index.html',1,219),(164,'Covid-19 hospitalization risk doubles with Delta variant, UK study suggests','A new study adds to growing evidence suggesting that the Delta coronavirus variant is not only highly transmissible, but also more dangerous., Covid-19 patients infected with the Delta variant had about double the risk of hospitalization compared to those infected with the Alpha variant, according to the study published Friday in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. , \"The results suggest that patients with the Delta variant had more than two times the risk of hospital admission compared with patients with the Alpha variant,\" researchers from Public Health England and the University of Cambridge wrote in their new study., \"Emergency care attendance combined with hospital admission was also higher for patients with the Delta variant, showing increased use of emergency care services as well as inpatient hospitalization,\" the researchers wrote., \'Getting fully vaccinated is crucial\', The study included data on 8,682 Covid-19 patients in England who were infected with the Delta variant and 34,656 infected with the Alpha variant. Across both groups, most of the patients -- 74% -- were unvaccinated., , The patients were tested for Covid-19 between March 29 and May 23 of this year, and the researchers examined how many of them were hospitalized., In general, 2.3% of patients with Delta and 2.2% of patients with Alpha were admitted to the hospital within two weeks after they were tested for Covid-19. But once the researchers accounted for certain factors that could raise a patient\'s risk for hospitalization, such as age or vaccination status, they found Delta was associated with a 2.26-fold increased risk of hospitalization compared with Alpha and 1.45-fold increased risk of requiring emergency care or hospital admission., , The researchers noted that their study results are similar to separate research previously conducted in Scotland that also found a higher risk of hospital admission within 14 days for patients infected with Delta versus Alpha., \"Our analysis highlights that in the absence of vaccination, any Delta outbreaks will impose a greater burden on healthcare than an Alpha epidemic,\" Dr. Anne Presanis, one of the study\'s lead authors and senior statistician at the University of Cambridge, said in a news release Friday., \"Getting fully vaccinated is crucial for reducing an individual\'s risk of symptomatic infection with Delta in the first place, and, importantly, of reducing a Delta patient\'s risk of severe illness and hospital admission,\" Presanis said., \'This is not a surprise\', Some doctors and scientists not involved in the new study have said that the findings confirm what was already thought -- that the Delta variant is more likely to cause serious disease., , \"These data confirm what we are seeing in clinical practice, namely that, in addition to the Delta variant being more infectious than the original or the Alpha variants, it is also causing more severe illness, in populations that previously would have had only mild infections,\" Dr. David Strain, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter who was not involved in the study, said in a written statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre., \"It highlights the need for a comprehensive vaccine program in younger adults and it clearly demonstrates the preconception that they do not get severe Covid is no longer true,\" Strain said. \"This is not a surprise, as the two things that make the Delta variant more infectious will also have a role in the disease severity.\", The researchers also noted in their study that new Covid-19 infections in England have been increasingly caused by the Delta variant. Although the proportion of cases in the study caused by the Delta variant was 20% overall, the researchers wrote, \"this increased to 74% of new sequenced cases in the week starting May 31, 2021.\", During this summer in the United States, the Delta variant overtook the Alpha variant, first identified in the United Kingdom, as the dominant coronavirus strain circulating., , \"The Delta variant was responsible for the uptick in Covid cases this summer in the UK, and many of us have heard of even vaccinated people that became infected,\" Dr. Zania Stamataki, viral immunologist at the University of Birmingham who was not involved in the new study, said in a separate statement from the Science Media Centre., \"The new study \"measures hospitalizations as a surrogate marker of severe disease, and the findings are clear: the Delta variant increases hospitalizations compared to the Alpha variant previously prevalent in the UK,\" Stamataki said. \"Taken together with previous studies showing that Delta is 50% more infectious than Alpha, evidence mounts that we are dealing with a very dangerous variant.

Then there are the typical distractions: Television, social media, video games and more. What\'s a parent to do?, Rest easy, experts say. There are tried and true techniques that can put your child back on a regular sleep schedule, which will help improve their academic performance and mood., \'Social jet lag\', Is your teen suffering from social jet lag? That wouldn\'t mean they are behind on making friends or going to parties -- in the sleep world, it\'s a term for the disparity between the number of hours you sleep during the week compared to the weekend. , \"Social jetlag occurs when people sleep later on the weekend than during the work or school week, and this leads to a delay in circadian timing,\" said sleep specialist Kenneth Wright, a professor of integrative psychology at the University of Colorado in Boulder., \"Come Monday morning, their clock is several time zones later, leading to a type of \'jet lag,\'\" Wright said., Teens are especially prone to staying up much later on weekends and sleeping in. But their natural sleep rhythm often keeps them up later on weekdays, too., Despite the overuse of screens and social media, it\'s not entirely their fault. When children hit puberty, they are biologically programmed to stay up later, experts say. There could be an \"evolutionary benefit\" for this change to promote independence, one study said, \"allowing young animals to occupy a distinct temporal niche from that of older, dominant individuals.\", What happens in the body, As a child nears puberty, levels of melatonin -- the sleep hormone -- begin to be secreted later in the day, moving his or her body clock from more of a \"day lark\" or morning type toward a \"night owl\" or evening type, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. , The pressure to fall asleep \"accumulates more slowly\" in the brain, which \"consequently results in difficulty falling asleep at an earlier bedtime,\" the AAP noted, resulting in as much as a two-hour shift in sleep/wake cycles in middle childhood., \"On a practical level, this research indicates that the average teenager in today\'s society has difficulty falling asleep before 11:00 p.m. and is best suited to wake at 8:00 a.m. or later,\" the AAP concluded. , The impact on health and safety, Teens ages 13 to 18 years old require between eight and 10 hours of sleep a day, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to allow their bodies to repair, consolidate memories and stay healthy. Pre-teens need between nine and 12 hours a night, the CDC says., Yet a 2015 CDC study found about 6 out of 10 middle school students (grades six through eight) did not get enough sleep on school nights, while about 7 out of 10 high school students (grades nine through 12) were sleep deprived. , Depriving teens of a full nine to 10 hours of sleep for just one night significantly slowed reaction and cognitive processing speed, while also reducing the teen\'s ability to stay attentive, according to a 2014 study., Other studies have shown a link between a decrease in sleep duration and lower academic achievement at the middle school, high school and college levels, as well as higher rates of absenteeism, tardiness and a decreased readiness to learn., \"Many studies have documented that the average adolescent in the United States is chronically sleep deprived and pathologically sleepy (i.e., regularly experiencing levels of sleepiness commensurate with those of patients with sleep disorders such as narcolepsy),\" the AAP stated. , A constant diet of insufficient sleep increases the dangers of social jet lag, which include insomnia, early waking or excessive sleepiness, daytime fatigue, difficulty concentrating, constipation or diarrhea, and an overall feeling of not being well, the AAP said., Previous studies on teen sleep found that fewer than eight hours a night was also associated with obesity, migraines, substance abuse, lack of exercise, sexual activity, feelings of depression and thoughts of suicide. Chronic sleep restriction also raises the risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, drowsy driving and more., Social jet lag also sets up teens to engage in more risky behavior, such as drinking or texting while driving or not wearing a seat belt or helmet, according to studies conducted by the CDC., What schools can do, Problems stemming from the teen sleep deficit are so bad that in 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement asking schools across the country to delay the start of middle and high school to no earlier than 8:30 a.m. The American Medical Association and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine have also put out statements calling for change., Research shows it helps: One study found that tweens and teens slept an additional 29 to 45 minutes each night when their school district delayed start times. Middle schools in the two-year study delayed their start times by 40 to 60 minutes, while high schools started 70 minutes later, ensuring a start time of 8:30 a.m. or after., When the Seattle school district included in the study moved the start time in middle and high schools from 7:50 a.m to 8:45 a.m. in 2016, they found students gained about 34 minutes of sleep a night, which resulted in a \"4.5% increase in the median grades of the students and an improvement in attendance.\", Even though some schools are heeding that call, the advocacy group Start School Later says that more than 4 in 5 schools  start classes earlier than the recommended time., What parents can do, With the added pressures of homework, extracurricular activities and the lure of social media, it can be tough to help a teen get better sleep. Experts suggest talking to your teen about the biological changes to their sleep cycle and discussing ways you can both work together to solve their sleep deficit. , Don\'t allow weekend sleep-ins. Try to wake your teen on weekends within one hour of his or her typical time to get up during the week for school. If they get up at 6 a.m. on weekdays, try to wake them by 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. at the latest on Saturday and Sunday., According to Children\'s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, the \"rule of thumb is every hour your teen sleeps in on the weekend it will take a day for the body to adjust.\", Try to get them to sleep earlier. Granted, you are battling a hormonal change in their body clock, but every little bit helps, experts say. Falling asleep just one half-hour earlier each night adds 3.5 hours toward curing any sleep deficit. , Parents, this applies to you, too. Set an example for your children by turning off the TV and going into your bedroom an hour before bedtime to relax and start your journey to sleep. If the entire house is shut down and quiet, it sends a message that sleep is a priority in your home. , Don\'t allow screens of any sort in the bedroom. All homework and social media or television should be done outside the bedroom, sleep experts stress. The brain needs to know that the bedroom is only for sleep, so that when you enter and begin your bedtime routine, the relaxation response is already underway., Set a relaxation routine. Invite everyone into the family room for some soothing music or an adult version of story time, where everyone reads or listens to audio books. Do some family yoga or turn on a meditation tape. , Mindfulness works -- schools that taught at-risk elementary children breathing techniques and yoga-based movement improved sleep by an average of 74 extra minutes a night, a new study found.

The FDA issued marketing denial orders for the electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) products, saying they pose a public health threat to youth in the US. Of the more than 55,000 products impacted by the decision, those not yet being sold may not be introduced into the market, and those already on the market must be removed or risk enforcement. , Advocates complained the action did not cover big name products such as Juul, but the agency said more decisions are coming., \"Ensuring new tobacco products undergo an evaluation by the FDA is a critical part of our aim to reduce tobacco-related disease and death,\" said Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock. \"We know that flavored tobacco products are very appealing to young people, therefore assessing the impact of potential or actual youth use is a critical factor in our decision-making about which products may be marketed.\", , Though e-cigarette products are often marketed as tools to help adults quit smoking cigarettes, health experts have been sounding the alarm for years over an alarming uptick in use among children and teens. , US e-cigarette sales rose by nearly 300% between November 2016 and August 2019, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 20% of high schoolers and almost 5% of middle schoolers reported using vape products in 2020, according to research published in the journal JAMA Network Open., Many point to the sweet flavors and flashy packaging of these products as proof that companies know exactly who they are marketing to., The non-tobacco, flavored e-cigarette products impacted by Thursday\'s decision -- which include flavors, like Apple Crumble, Dr. Cola and Cinnamon Toast Cereal -- are made by three companies: JD Nova Group LLC, Great American Vapes and Vapor Salon.,  Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said the decision is a step in the right direction, but does not go far enough., , \"The FDA\'s action covers just a fraction of the more than 6.5 million tobacco products for which the FDA has received marketing applications, and it does not include any e-cigarette brands with a significant market share or that are most popular with kids, such as Juul, the number one youth brand,\" Myers told CNN in a statement., The FDA said it\'s making its way through those applications, submitted by 500 companies by the September 2020 deadline for deemed new tobacco products to apply for pre-market review., The agency is tasked with determining whether these products \"have a benefit to adult smokers sufficient to overcome the public health threat posed by the well-documented, alarming levels of youth use of such products.\", , , \"Flavored ENDS products are extremely popular among youth, with over 80% of e-cigarette users between ages 12 through 17 using one of these products,\" said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA\'s Center for Tobacco Products. \"Companies who want to continue to market their flavored ENDS products must have robust and reliable evidence showing that their products\' potential benefit for adult smokers outweighs the significant known risk to youth.\", In February 2020, the Trump administration enacted a \"flavor ban,\" establishing that the Food and Drug Administration would prioritize enforcement against flavored, cartridge-based vaping products., Because disposable vapes, some e-liquids, and tobacco and menthol flavored products were exempted from the policy, health experts expressed concern that it would simply redirect users to those available products., \"In 2020, over one million middle and high school students used menthol e-cigarettes, including 44.5% of youth who used flavored, pre-filled cartridge products like Juul,\" Myers said., , , The FDA\'s decision is \"not a substitute for comprehensive action to eliminate all flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol-flavored products that are popular with and widely used by kids,\" he added., The FDA noted the scientific review of menthol e-cigarettes, as opposed to other non-tobacco flavored e-cigarettes, raises \"unique considerations.\", While menthol products were not included in Thursday\'s decision, the FDA\'s evaluation of those applications will consider the same question: Does the benefit to adult users outweigh the risk to youth?','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/26/health/fda-blocks-ecig-products/index.html',1,222),(167,'Abbott warns of some constraints on Covid-19 home test supply as Delta surge leads to \'unprecedented demand\'','Abbott Laboratories says the supply of its at-home Covid-19 tests may be constrained in the coming weeks as demand has grown to \"unprecedented\" levels during the current surge of coronavirus infections driven by the highly transmissible Delta variant., \"We\'re seeing unprecedented demand as case rates rise -- and we\'ve been scaling up manufacturing since Delta became the dominant strain and new CDC guidance called for a re-prioritization of testing,\" Abbott spokesperson John Koval wrote in the email to CNN on Thursday., \"Today, there are tens of millions of BinaxNOW tests in various settings and supply chains.

They\'re literally sitting ducks.\", The rise has come while 48.3% of the population is not fully vaccinated, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- and as the daily average of newly reported cases has climbed to more than 151,000., Health experts have been particularly concerned about cases among children as students return to school, many without mask mandates and without access to vaccines. , Pfizer/BioNTech\'s vaccine was fully approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on Monday for Americans 16 and older, which National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told CNN was a \"ray of sunshine in the midst of all these dark Covid clouds.\", The two companies said Wednesday they have begun to submit data, including that from a trial with 306 people, to the US Food and Drug Administration for approval of a booster dose of their Covid-19 vaccine., Moderna announced  it has completed its submission to the FDA for full approval of its Covid-19 vaccine for people 18 and older. Moderna said it has requested priority review from the agency. Moderna\'s vaccine is currently available under emergency use authorization for people age 18 and older. The company began submitting data for approval to the FDA in June., Still, children younger than 16 aren\'t fully approved for a vaccine, and the emergency use authorizations in place only cover adolescents 12 and older. , Children ages 5 to 11 are the next group in line to become eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine, and an updated emergency use authorization from the FDA would make at least 28 million additional children -- representing about 9% of the US population -- eligible to receive the vaccine, according to a CNN analysis of federal data., You asked, we\'re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines, , But the process of authorizing a vaccine for that age group may not be completed until the end of the year, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN\'s Brianna Keilar., The timing is a problem, Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA\'s vaccines advisory committee, told CNN, because the more transmissible Delta variant is spreading and the cold dry weather of the winter months makes it easier for the virus to spread -- all while children are sitting together in classrooms. , \"You are going to have a group of fully susceptible people all in one place,\" he told Jake Tapper. \"That\'s not a good recipe.\", And though it would be good to have vaccines for children before then, it is important for health officials to take their time in making sure the vaccines are tested heavily -- and deemed safe., \"We\'re moving as quickly as we can, it\'s just not easy to move that quickly when you talk about doing big vaccine trials,\" said Offit., Hospitalizations surpass the six-figure mark, More than 100,000 people are hospitalized with Covid-19 in the US, the first time the country has surpassed that mark since January, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services., Covid-19 hospitalizations have been on the rise in the US since early July. They\'ve nearly tripled in the past month, and have grown by 10% in the past week alone. Current hospitalizations are about 71% of the peak from January 14, according to HHS data., Florida and Texas account for nearly a third (31%) of current Covid-19 hospitalizations. Florida has the worst per capita hospitalization rate in the country -- about 80 hospitalizations per 100,000 people -- followed by Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Louisiana, each with more than 55 hospitalizations per 100,000 people., Covid-19 hospitalization rates are still highest among seniors, but the gap is smaller than it was during the winter surge. In fact, Covid-19 hospitalization rates among children and adults under 50 are the highest they\'ve ever been, CDC data shows., An ensemble forecast published Wednesday by the CDC projects that new Covid-19 hospitalizations are likely to remain stable or have an uncertain trend over the next four weeks. It\'s the first time since mid-July the forecast did not project an increasing level of hospitalizations., , Wednesday\'s forecast predicts there will be 7,800 to 27,000 new confirmed Covid-19 hospital admissions likely reported on September 20. Since July 14, the forecasts had projected that hospitalizations would increase each week., The forecast also predicts that new Covid-19 deaths will likely increase over the next four weeks, projecting a total of 651,000 to 680,000 deaths reported by September 18. The previous forecast, published August 18, predicted up to 664,000 Covid-19 deaths by September 11. , As with previous weeks, the agency says that its Covid-19 cases forecast should be interpreted with caution because actual numbers have fallen outside the range of previous predictions. , Schools take different approaches to rising cases , As cases rise among children, some school leaders are pressing for precautions while others are banning mask mandates., Throughout Florida\'s 15 largest school districts, at least 11,851 students and 2,610 employees have tested positive for Covid-19, amounting to more than 14,461 confirmed cases since the school districts started keeping track of cases for the 2021-22 school year, according to a CNN analysis., Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has issued an executive order banning schools from instituting mask mandates, but eight counties have defied the order as cases have grown. , South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster also issued a ban on mask mandates, prompting a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, according to a complaint filed Tuesday. , , \"This is a disability rights issue,\" said Susan Mizner, ACLU disability rights program director.  , \"Students with health conditions or disabilities that make them vulnerable to COVID have a right to attend school without endangering their health or safety. Schools who have children with these conditions have legal obligations under federal disability rights laws,\" Mizner said in an ACLU statement.  , McMaster\'s spokesperson Brian Symmes declined to specifically comment on the lawsuit, but said, \"The only truly inclusive option is to allow every parent to decide whether their child will wear a mask in school.\", , , On the other hand, the Los Angeles Unified School District has implemented strong mitigation measures and appears to have kept infection rates under 1% during the first week of classes., The school district, the second-largest in the country, enacted the measures throughout its more than 1,000 schools., Teachers and employees are required to be fully vaccinated by October 15. Masks are required for all students, staff and visitors. The district also has a \"cohort\" model in place, which aims to keep as many students in the same classroom and with the same group of students as often as possible., A rigorous and costly testing initiative has also been put into place. Every student and employee must undergo free weekly testing regardless of vaccination status in order to be able to enter a school. , The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has implemented a mask mandate in all public K-12 schools, effective immediately., It applies to students 5 and older, teachers and staff, according to a news release from the education department., The mandate is in full effect through October 1. After that date, middle and high school officials can lift the mandate for vaccinated students and staff, provided 80% of students and staff in a school building are vaccinated, the release says.

Among eligible groups, teens are also the least likely to be vaccinated. , \"The simple answer is -- you have a virus that\'s highly infectious. It\'s going to spread to the people who are most vulnerable, and that\'s going to be the people who are least likely to be vaccinated,\" Benjamin said. \"And it\'s still true that the younger people are still least likely to be vaccinated.\", Earlier on in the pandemic, the original strain of the coronavirus infected older adults and essential workers at high rates, Benjamin said, but now, most of the people in those groups are fully vaccinated., \"As this goes on, who gets exposed changes. Everybody else is vaccinated, they don\'t get infected, so now we\'re seeing, at least statistically, the people who are getting infected changing,\" Benjamin said., \"Add to the fact that we have this new virus, and this new virus is going to do a couple of things. One, it\'s clearly much more infectious than the other viruses, and it\'s going to hit the ones who are most vulnerable,\" Benjamin said, referring to the Delta variant of the coronavirus. \"Who are the most vulnerable? It\'s the people that aren\'t vaccinated and the people who are out and about.\", \'The sad reality is that we have a solution\', There could be some biological mechanisms behind why older teens appear to have Covid-19 case rates higher than other children -- but that\'s not really clear, said Dr. Sean O\'Leary, professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at University of Colorado\'s School of Medicine., \"My suspicion is it probably has more to do with behavior than biology, in terms of, what are those kids doing? They\'re able to drive on their own, they\'re hanging out after school, getting together with other kids their age, likely often without the mitigation measures that would be in place in school,\" O\'Leary said., And children overall are now even more vulnerable as they head back to school this month., \"The sad reality is that we have a solution that adequately protects adolescents over sixteen years old. We have the Pfizer vaccine approved for that age group. So, we really shouldn\'t be seeing high case rates in that age group if we\'re successful with vaccinating late teens who are eligible,\" Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said., \"I am more worried about what we\'ll see in the next three weeks if trending follows to younger ages under 16. Without a vaccine solution yet for younger children, we\'re going to see more of what we\'re starting to hear now -- schools having to make decisions about pausing in-person learning for a week or so,\" Freeman said. \"There might be those kinds of temporary measures that allow schools to get back on their feet if in-person learning begins to impact transmission in the younger ages with school reopenings.\", More kids are catching Covid-19, In the past month, adults ages 18 to 29 consistently have had the highest weekly Covid-19 case rates of all. But as of Saturday, older children ages 16 and 17 took that position with 160.3 weekly Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people, according to CDC data. Of course, as more cases are reported to the CDC, the case rates are likely to rise and the data may change., In comparison, adolescents ages 12 to 15 had a weekly Covid-19 case rate of 152.7, children ages 5 to 11 saw a weekly rate of 137 and kids younger than 5 had a rate of 79.4, the data showed., , Among adults, as of Saturday, people ages 18 to 29 saw a weekly case rate of 151.9, ages 30 to 39 had a rate of 152.9, ages 40 to 49 were at 129.6, ages 50 to 64 saw 95.9, ages 65 to 74 had 71.2 and adults 75 and older were at 63.5., In the past month, older teens ages 16 and 17 have had the highest weekly Covid-19 case rate among all children, climbing from a rate of about 48 per 100.000 on July 10 to about 200 per 100,000 on August 14, before declining last week., The CDC notes that there may be up to a two-week delay in case reporting., Overall, a total of nearly 800,000 Covid-19 cases so far have been among teens ages 16 and 17, representing about 2.6% of all cases nationwide. This age group makes up 2.5% of the US population. Their older peers, ages 18 to 29, make up the largest share of Covid-19 cases nationwide with around 6.7 million infections so far -- representing 22.7% of all cases, even though this age group makes up 16.4% of the US population., , As more young people become fully vaccinated against Covid-19, that should drive down case rates among teenagers -- and the hope is to keep more teens out of the hospital and intensive care units., \"That older age group, particularly when they have risk factors, tend to be a little bit higher risk for hospitalization. It\'s the under one and then the older teens, in the pediatric age group, who tend to be the higher risk groups for hospitalization, said O\'Leary at the University of Colorado., About 8 million or 32% of all adolescents ages 12 to 17 are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 so far and \"nationally, roughly half of 16- to 17-year-olds have gotten a first dose, and so that\'s a lot of unvaccinated in that age group,\" O\'Leary said., As more teens receive the vaccine, it will still take a while to see the effects., \"What we saw from the clinical trials going way back, and I don\'t think we have anything to suggest that things are different now, is you start to see an effect roughly after two weeks after the first dose and then, the biggest effect starting roughly one to two weeks after the second dose,\" O\'Leary said, adding that one dose of vaccine appears to be less effective against the Delta variant., \"But also remember that vaccination is rolling -- it\'s not like all of a sudden everyone is going to get it today and so five weeks from now we\'ll see a big impact,\" he said. \"It\'s that there will be more people getting it today and tomorrow and the next day, and so it\'s really a rolling impact.

The data, which involved both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, included only laboratory-confirmed cases of infection and were representative of infections in the county alone, not the entire United States., \"The findings in this report are similar to those from recent studies indicating that Covid-19 vaccination protects against severe Covid-19 in areas with increasing prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant,\" the researchers wrote., The country has averaged more than 152,400 new Covid-19 cases a day over the past week -- more than 13 times what the figure was about nine weeks ago, according to data from Johns Hopkins University., , 12-hour wait in a Tampa emergency room, With 48.3% of the US still not fully vaccinated, hospitals are straining to keep up with incoming patients as cases rise., Florida has been hit particularly hard, with the worst per capita Covid-19 hospitalization rate in the country -- about 80 per 100,000 people.

John Bel Edwards said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/26/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html',1,230),(172,'Respiratory infections other than Covid-19 are filling up pediatric wards','Texas Children\'s Hospital is seeing a surge of coronavirus cases -- nearly all of them caused by the Delta variant. Not only are kids showing up in greater numbers, but they\'re sicker, too.On top of it, many are infected with a second virus at the same time -- usually respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV., A fresh surge of Covid-19 is colliding with an unseasonable epidemic of RSV, and it\'s landing kids in hospitals across the country., \"The past few days, the past week, we\'ve been seeing high numbers of children coming in,\" said Dr. Sarah Combs, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Children\'s National Hospital in Washington, DC., \"You name it -- anything from the common cold to pneumonia to having respiratory distress, meaning we need to get some support breathing, and they\'re just coming in in higher and higher numbers,\" Combs told CNN. \"In the summer, typically RSV is a non-issue. It\'s just not there.\", It\'s the same in Texas., \"This Delta surge has been coupled with the re-emergence of other respiratory viruses,\" said Dr. Jim Versalovic, interim pediatrician in chief at Texas Children\'s Hospital in Houston., And in Ohio., \"We are definitely seeing more RSV,\" Dr. Joshua Schaffzin, director of infection prevention and control at Cincinnati Children\'s Hospital, told CNN., \'Christmas in July\' -- without the joy, \"It\'s not seasonal. I have been calling it Christmas in July, because we usually see it around Christmas,\" he added., \"It\'s not exactly a gift. We are just seeing it at a time we typically don\'t.\", The three hospitals, among others, are also seeing high numbers of other respiratory viruses such as parainfluenza 3, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses that cause hand, foot and mouth disease and other conditions., \"The interesting thing with rhinovirus is that normally it would cause just the common cold,\" Combs said., \"It\'s normally a very mild virus. It\'s the most common cause of the common cold, so it is unusual that we\'re seeing children get sicker than we\'d expect. And really what we see is that children are just getting that much sicker, you know, they may be requiring things like BiPap to breathe.\" Bilevel positive airway pressure devices are a non-invasive type of ventilator that help ensure the lungs keep filling up with oxygenated air., It\'s all new for 2021., In 2020, Versalovic told CNN, \"it was really mainly about Covid.\", Now, hospitals are not only seeing more kids with Covid-19, and sicker than they were with Covid-19, but they\'re sicker with viruses that normally do not land most children in the hospital., \"We are working with other children\'s hospitals and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Children\'s Hospital Association to share data to explore this further,\" Versalovic said., The CDC warned doctors last June of a growing number of cases of RSV across the US South. CDC data show a continuing upsurge of RSV across the rest of the country now., \"The cases are there. The cases are rising. The children are getting sick. And so we need to be prepared to take care of them,\" Combs said., The pediatricians see some clear reasons for what\'s causing the surges, and equally clear ways forward for preventing them., Back to school for kids, and germs, too, \"I think it\'s clear over the summer months we had children mingling playing out and about,\" Versalovic said. \"Many children are now congregating in preschool and obviously grade school environments -- high schools too. So we also know they\'re involved in extracurricular activities and getting together socially and playing,\" he added., \"And we want children to develop and to be in class in person, but we have to continue to emphasize the importance of masking. Because masking doesn\'t just protect one from Covid but could also prevent these co-infections.\", There\'s another factor. Kids have not been exposed to seasonal viruses for more than a year., \"I think one thing is that we essentially sheltered a lot of these children during Covid,\" Combs said., \"So there\'s a theory that their immune systems didn\'t have the normal low-lying, routine level of exposure to the normal routine viruses like rhinovirus, so they weren\'t able to mount those kind of micro-responses to viruses and keep themselves ticking over,\" she added., \"Essentially it was like a bubble child, right? You\'ve had them contained. You\'ve had them quarantined ... and then all of a sudden we released these children. They\'re often in summer camps and we\'re even looking at going back to school. So all of a sudden these relatively naive immune systems that have kind of been resting on their laurels for the past 18 months are forced to confront the normal load of viruses and it\'s just that much harder to fight them.\", On top of that, said Schaffzin, people got tired of wearing masks, of washing hands, of keeping apart. The heat of summer drove many people back indoors., \"We can\'t say for sure whether the unmasking and people wanting to spend time with each other is causing more of an increase, but we\'re certainly seeing a lot more infections and for RSV, not at the typical time of year,\" he said., The benefits of all that masking and social distancing earlier in the pandemic was made clear by the lack of a flu season in 2020-2021, Schaffzin said., \"On average, 125 children die of flu in the United States every year, but the range is between 40 to closer to 200,\" he said., \"Last year, there was one. And that\'s why masking, again, seems to be the answer.\", The CDC did indeed report just a single pediatric flu death last season., \"I think this statistic of a single flu death last season in the United States was really striking, and there were many, many school systems that were open and functioning, many daycares that were open and functioning,\" Schaffzin said., \"And I think that really proves, the real-world data shows us, that masking is an inexpensive and effective intervention,\" he added., Masks won\'t hurt you. Really, People don\'t like masks, but the pediatricians agreed that parents and governors making a fuss over mask mandates are wrongheaded., \"I\'m not going to lie -- you\'re outside and there\'s 100% humidity, a high heat index, it doesn\'t feel great,\" Combs said., But it\'s not dangerous to anyone to wear a mask., \"When people are uncomfortable from the mask it\'s because they feel overheated and they\'re either getting a little anxious, or the mask is uncomfortable. It\'s close up against their mouth. Sometimes they breathe in and they can feel it against their lips and it\'s not something they\'re accustomed to. And it makes people feel out of breath,\" Schaffzin said., \"It is a sensation. It is not an increase of carbon dioxide. It is not anything internal that\'s dangerous.\", And children don\'t mind masks unless their parents tell them they should., \"Kids tolerate masks really well. Kids tolerate masks a lot more than adults give them credit for,\" Schaffzin said., \"Especially if you make it fun, if you make it colorful or something that they enjoy, kids will not only have no problem but they\'ll want to wear the masks,\" he added., \"If you normalize masking, which is normal in many countries around the world, the controversy goes away.\", The same goes for hand hygiene., \"You know there are lots of things that we do that we do for our own health that may not impact others\' health. We brush our teeth. Some of us floss, exercise and whatnot, and what we do is we build those methods and those events into our daily routine, so that it feels weird if we don\'t do them,\" Schaffzin said., \"We\'re more likely to notice that we haven\'t brushed our teeth than we are to remember brushing our teeth on a given day. And what I would like to see is Covid prevention methods to be similar to that.\", The pediatricians note that it\'s true masks can interfere with communication, especially in classrooms, where seeing someone\'s mouth or expression might be important., \"We need more data in terms of the social effects of masks and we can\'t dismiss that outright,\" Schaffzin said., There are work-arounds. For instance, clear masks, sometimes used at children\'s hospitals, can help, he said., \"There\'s always a way around it. Humans innovate. It\'s what they do,\" he added., \'We can control a pandemic\', \"We have not found a way to prevent every respiratory disease, but we do have mechanisms, including hand hygiene and including masking and including avoiding people who are sick, that when we do them together, reliably, we actually can prevent transmission,\" Schaffzin said. \"We can control a pandemic.\", Combs echoed this., \"What we know, numbers wise, is that we were successful when we put all the measures in place,\" she said. But people have started letting down their guard., \"There\'s a lot of fatigue around with doing the same things over and over, especially with seeing these peaks come and go and come and go. But what we do know is that when we mask appropriately, especially if you have a well-fitting mask or even a double mask technique, if everyone in a certain area is wearing that appropriate masking, that\'s going to be about 95% effective at preventing transmission or spread,\" she said., And that will be the same whether the virus being kept at bay is Covid-19, or RSV, or rhinovirus or parainfluenza virus.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/26/health/respiratory-viruses-kids-rsv-rhinovirus-covid/index.html',1,233),(173,'Moderna completes submission for full FDA approval of Covid-19 vaccine; Pfizer seeks approval for booster dose','Moderna announced on Wednesday it has completed its submission to the US Food and Drug Administration for full approval of its Covid-19 vaccine for people age 18 and older, and Pfizer and BioNTech announced they have begun submitting data for full FDA approval of a third dose of their vaccine.Moderna said it has requested priority review from the FDA. The company began submitting data for its Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the FDA in June., \"This BLA submission for our COVID-19 vaccine, which we began in June, is an important milestone in our battle against COVID-19 and for Moderna, as this is the first BLA submission in our company\'s history,\" Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement., The Moderna vaccine is currently available under emergency use authorization for people age 18 and older in the United States. Moderna has also filed with the FDA for an emergency use authorization for its vaccine in people age 12 and older., Moderna\'s vaccine would be the second one approved by the FDA. On Monday, the FDA approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for people age 16 an older, opening the door to more vaccine mandates., Even with priority review, the approval process typically takes months; the FDA moved resources around in order to be able to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in less time., Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA\'s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Monday that the agency worked around the clock to conduct its own analyses and inspect facilities, completing all the same work it would for any approval., \"It\'s actually 97 days since Pfizer completed the role of its BLA and the clock started, which means that we completed this in about 40% of the normal clock time for a submission of this magnitude,\" Marks said Monday., Pfizer/BioNTech seek approval of third dose , Pfizer and BioNTech said on Wednesday they intend to complete the submission of their supplemental Biologics License Application for a third dose of Covid-19 vaccine by the end of this week., In a news release, the companies described a trial of 306 people who got a booster between nearly five and eight months after getting the second dose. It found it generated higher levels of antibodies and was safe, with \"mild to moderate\" effects, most commonly including injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain and chills., Pfizer said it will submit the data to a peer-reviewed journal and file it with the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory authorities around the world in the coming weeks., The two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was approved for people age 16 and older on Monday. A third dose of the vaccine is also available in the United States to certain people age 12 and older who are immunocompromised., US health official recently announced the government planned to make booster doses available to fully vaccinated individuals eight months after receiving their second dose of an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine. They said booster doses would start the week of September 20, pending sign-off from the FDA and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/25/health/moderna-vaccine-fda-submission/index.html',1,234),(174,'Johnson &amp; Johnson booster shot prompts large increase in immune response, company says','Booster doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s one-shot coronavirus vaccine generated a big spike in antibodies, the frontline immune system defenses against infection, the company reported Wednesday.People who received a booster six to eight months after their initial J&amp;J shots saw antibodies increase nine-fold higher than 28 days after the first shot, Johnson &amp; Johnson said., The data comes from two Phase 2 studies conducted in the United States and Europe, the company said in a statement. Some of the 2,000 or so people in the studies got booster doses six months after their first doses of J&amp;J\'s Janssen vaccine., \"New interim data from these studies demonstrate that a booster dose of the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine generated a rapid and robust increase in spike-binding antibodies, nine-fold higher than 28 days after the primary single-dose vaccination,\" the company said in its statement., \"We have established that a single shot of our COVID-19 vaccine generates strong and robust immune responses that are durable and persistent through eight months. With these new data, we also see that a booster dose of the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine further increases antibody responses among study participants who had previously received our vaccine,\" Dr. Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development for Janssen, said in a statement., J&amp;J said it was in discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, European Medicines Agency, World Health Organization and other health authorities about the need for offering a booster dose of the Janssen vaccine., \"We look forward to discussing with public health officials a potential strategy for our Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, boosting eight months or longer after the primary single-dose vaccination,\" Mammen added., Many people who received the J&amp;J vaccine have been clamoring for information about whether they will need a booster shot. US federal government officials have said they are preparing to start offering a booster dose to people who got Moderna\'s or Pfizer\'s Covid-19 vaccine after data showed boosters can amp up the antibody response -- and after studies started showing an uptick in infections in both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. The more transmissible Delta variant is partly to blame, experts say, as is a waning immune response., The Janssen vaccine was authorized at the end of February, more than two months after Moderna\'s and Pfizer\'s vaccines were authorized. About 14 million Americans have received the J&amp;J vaccine, according to the CDC., Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine researcher at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School who is not involved in the two clinical studies but is helping study J&amp;J vaccines, said the findings support getting a booster shot, but only after a delay., \"The boost at six months is going to look very impressive and substantially greater than what has already been reported in terms of the two month boost, and that is significant because it, in my opinion, the boost should not be at two months, but it really should be at six months or later,\" Barouch told CNN., Neither of the studies looked at real-world efficacy, so the company has not demonstrated that people who get boosters will be less likely to become infected or to develop severe disease. But researchers are beginning to agree that antibody levels do indicate immune protection., The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is made differently from Pfizer\'s and Moderna\'s. Those two vaccines use messenger RNA or mRNA, encased in little lipid particles, to carry instructions to the body to start an immune response., The Janssen vaccine uses a crippled common cold virus called an adenovirus to carry in similar instructions. There had been worries that a booster dose of such a viral vector vaccine might not work effectively because of the possibility the body would generate an immune response against the vector, also., \"There was a theoretical concern that the generation of anti-vector antibodies by the first shot could impede the use of it again,\" Barouch said., \"I think these data put that to rest.\", Federal health officials have said they believe a booster dose of the Janssen vaccine will be needed at some point., \"I\'m quite certain that the FDA, CDC, NIH, White House will use these data to likely justify or recommend a booster for J&amp;J-vaccinated people, probably with a second shot of J&amp;J,\" Barouch said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/25/health/johnson-vaccine-booster-data/index.html',1,235),(175,'What does it mean for the Pfizer vaccine to have full FDA approval? Our medical expert weighs in','The US Food and Drug AdministrationWhat does full approval mean for those who are already vaccinated? What about for those who have yet to vaccinated — could it help to reduce hesitancy? Does it have any impact on expediting vaccines for younger children?, To help us with these questions, we turned to CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She\'s also author of a new book, \"Lifelines: A Doctor\'s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.\", CNN: What does \"full approval\" mean? How does it differ from what the vaccine\'s status was before? And does the full approval apply only to the Pfizer vaccine?, Dr. Leana Wen: For months now, there have been three vaccines that were approved under emergency use authorization, or EUA. These are the vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson. The Pfizer was the first of the vaccines to receive the EUA, and it\'s also the first of the vaccines that applied for full approval., Full FDA approval is a process that usually requires at least six months of safety data. The EUA was given after two months of safety data because this is a global pandemic and a public health emergency. Hundreds of millions of people around the world have now received the Pfizer vaccine, and there is more than enough evidence that the vaccine is safe and effective. The final stamp of approval came via the FDA on Monday., Pfizer\'s vaccine is now fully approved for people 16 years of age and older. Moderna\'s vaccine is under review, and I\'d expect that approval will come within a matter of weeks. Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s request for full approval has not yet been submitted to the FDA. These two other vaccines continue to available under the EUA., CNN: What does full approval mean for those who already got the Covid-19 vaccine?, Wen: Many of us in public health expect that full FDA approval will have a significant impact on increasing vaccination numbers for those who are not yet vaccinated. There really isn\'t an impact on those who already got vaccinated., CNN: Do you think it could convince some people to finally get vaccinated?, Wen: Possibly, yes. Some polls, including from the Kaiser Family Foundation, have suggested that as many as 3 in 10 people cite lack of full approval as a primary reason for not getting the vaccine. It\'s possible that some of these individuals will now overcome their hesitancy, but I suspect there will be a much smaller number who will line up to get vaccinated soon after full approval., The much bigger impetus, I think, is going to come from vaccine mandates. Many companies and colleges have already mandated vaccines, but many others have been waiting for full approval to take this step. There are many people who might not have gotten the vaccine on their own, but if required to, would do so., CNN: Are there actual medical reasons as to why someone should choose not to be vaccinated at this point?, Wen: It would be extraordinarily unusual for someone to have a medical reason in which they absolutely could not receive the Covid-19 vaccine. An individual could have a severe allergic reaction to one of the components of the vaccine, but then they could probably get another vaccine. Someone who has an autoimmune condition could have concerns about an immune reaction, but if they\'ve been able to get other vaccines, they should be able to get this one, with careful monitoring from their physician., There are individuals concerned about the impact of the vaccine on pregnancy and fertility, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend the vaccine for pregnant women as well as women looking to conceive. Then there are people who may not respond as well to the vaccine because they may not mount enough of an immune response including people with cancer or HIV. These are people who may need three vaccine doses and still need to mask and distance to protect themselves even after vaccinated — but there is no reason why they shouldn\'t be vaccinated in the first place., CNN: Why wasn\'t the vaccine fully approved for kids ages 12 to 15? Should parents still get kids in this age group vaccinated if it\'s not fully approved yet?, Wen: The initial Pfizer studies were done in those 16 and above. Those are the data that were submitted for full approval. The vaccine is authorized under the EUA for kids ages 12 to 15. There just haven\'t been enough time for the vaccine in this age group to receive full approval., That said, the EUA is sufficient to demonstrate the vaccine is safe and effective in the adolescent 12- to 15-year-old age group. Especially as kids are returning back to school and Covid-19 cases are surging across the country, it\'s really important to protect as many kids as possible who are eligible to be vaccinated. I\'d strongly recommend for children 12 and over to be vaccinated now., CNN: Will the full FDA approval speed up vaccine development for kids under age 12?, Wen: No. Those studies are still ongoing. Dr. Anthony Fauci said to CNN\'s Anderson Cooper on Monday night that it\'s possible that vaccines for younger children will be available in 2021, but results from these studies have not yet been presented to the FDA., CNN: Some parents are wondering if they should ask their doctor to vaccinate their 10- or 11-year-old kids. Is this something that can be done?, Wen: Technically, full approval of the vaccine means that it can be prescribed off-label like any other medication or therapeutic, meaning that doctors can use their clinical judgment to prescribe the vaccine to patients. However, the acting FDA commissioner specifically warned against off-label use of the vaccine to younger children, citing the need for more studies, including testing of different dosages that are still in progress., There are other ways to protect younger children in the meantime. Indoor masking remains imperative, and vaccinating all adults around the child is also of paramount importance. Which brings me back to the central point of this week\'s FDA announcement. There really should be no reason to wait — now is the time to get vaccinated for those who have not yet already.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/25/health/fda-approval-pfizer-vaccine-wen-wellness/index.html',1,236),(176,'Vaccines are less protective against Delta infection but still reduce risk by two-thirds, CDC study shows','Vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 infection dropped from 91% to 66% once the Delta variant accounted for the majority of circulating virus, according to a \"While we did see a reduction in the protection of the Covid-19 vaccine against the Delta variant, it\'s still two-thirds reduction of risk,\" lead author Ashley Fowlkes, an epidemiologist for CDC Covid-19 Emergency Response, told CNN on Tuesday., The study is in line with others from the US and around the world showing Delta\'s increased tendency to cause largely minor infections among fully vaccinated people. Still, the effectiveness of vaccines against severe disease -- including hospitalization and death -- has remained high against all known variants., The current study does not cover disease severity, however. Instead, the new paper is the latest chapter in an ongoing study that has been following \"health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers\" who receive weekly PCR tests in eight locations across six US states. The vast majority are vaccinated., The study\'s reliance on regular, weekly testing makes it possible to capture a more complete picture of Covid-19 infections in a group, since people with mild or no symptoms may be less likely to get tested overall. In the official vaccine trials, efficacy was calculated against symptomatic Covid-19 -- not all infections., Still, the authors warn there is some uncertainty in these estimates, in part because they found relatively few infections in the first place. During the months when Delta was predominant, researchers found 19 infections among 488 unvaccinated people, and 24 infections among 2,352 fully vaccinated people., While waning immunity may also contribute to some degree of reduced protection, the current study was unable to show this to a significant degree. Separate research suggests that even if a fully vaccinated person gets infected with the virus, they may be less likely to spread it. About 51.5% of the population is fully vaccinated, according to data from the CDC., The study\'s authors are planning future analyses comparing the different Covid-19 vaccines as well as the types of symptoms experienced by vaccinated and unvaccinated people who become infected., \"It\'s still a very powerful vaccine,\" Fowlkes added, especially when it comes to more severe outcomes. \"But we are also looking towards continuing to use masks for a little bit longer.\", Separately, a new study out of Los Angeles County reaffirms that fully vaccinated people are far less likely than unvaccinated people to be hospitalized, admitted to an intensive care unit, require mechanical ventilation or die from Covid-19., \"On July 25, infection and hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons were 4.9 and 29.2 times, respectively, those in fully vaccinated persons,\" researchers from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health wrote in the study, which was published Tuesday by the CDC., Fauci: Covid could be \'under control\' by spring, Despite these studies about the benefits of vaccination, tens of millions of people have hesitated to get the shots. Because of that, hospitals in many states with lower vaccination rates are overwhelmed by a surge in patients, students are returning to the classroom only to have to isolate due to exposure and cases among children are on the rise., Mississippi reported 111 new Covid-19-related deaths on Tuesday, a one-day record, said state epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers. Some 87% of new deaths are among the unvaccinated and more than 50% are over the age of 65, he said. Gov. Tate Reeves said more than 1,000 health care workers have arrived to help with hospital staffing shortages., \"Getting boots on the ground this quickly is a step in the right direction,\" he said., Florida, too, reported a record high average of about 212 Covid-19 deaths each day last week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University., Dr. Anthony Fauci urged the public to get vaccinated and said if the \"overwhelming majority\" of the population does so the US could have the pandemic \"under control\" by spring 2022., \"We hope we\'ll be there ... but there\'s no guarantee because it\'s up to us,\" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the President\'s chief medical adviser, told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper on Monday. , It isn\'t yet clear to health experts what proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated to reach a level of protection that could sustain a return to normalcy, like safely going to restaurants and theaters, Fauci said. So the best way forward is to vaccinate as many people as possible, he said., Still, Fauci\'s spring 2022 timeline is daunting politically for President Joe Biden, who already declared partial victory over the virus on July 4. In addition, CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta questioned the definition of what it means to \"control\" a virus that looks to be here for the long haul., \"This is one of those situations where I think defining what it means to be in control of the pandemic is really important,\" Gupta said Tuesday., \"If we have more people vaccinated, it\'s likely we will decouple hospitalizations from cases, and maybe that will be a definition of control. (If) people aren\'t getting that sick anymore, ending up in the hospital, the virus starts to slowly not have places to circulate, that will be a definition of control. I think we\'re going to see waves of this for some time,\" he added., FDA\'s approval opens door for mandates, On Monday, the US Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for people 16 and older, a move that health officials hope will convince hesitant Americans to get vaccinated., \"I do think that the approval the FDA announced yesterday for the Pfizer vaccine is a milestone in our vaccination efforts and it reaffirms what we have been seeing for months,\" US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN. \"Which is that the vaccines are highly effective, they\'ve a very strong safety profile and they\'re what we need to get through this pandemic.\", There are still nearly 80 million people eligible to be vaccinated who have not done so., \"I do think there will be a modest increase, but, look, we have a long way to go to fill this gap,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, vaccinologist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. \"I think having the full approval will certainly convince some, but it\'s just one of a dozen fake talking points put out there by the disinformation campaign. And, I think a number of people are just going to revert to one of the other ones.\", The FDA\'s approval also opens the door for businesses and government bodies to mandate vaccinations, and some have already begun to do so., New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio mandated the vaccine for all Department of Education employees, including teachers, on Monday. In addition, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo released a statement Monday, before he left office, calling for all New York state employers to require Covid-19 vaccination. The state already requires all eligible government and health care employees to be vaccinated., Now that the FDA granted full approval to the Pfizer vaccine, the next focus is authorizing a Covid vaccine for children ages 5 to 11. That could come by the end of the year under an updated emergency use authorization, officials have said., If and when that authorization comes, at least 28 million additional children -- representing about 9% of the US population -- would become eligible to receive the vaccine, according to a CNN analysis of federal data., If vaccination trends among the 5 to 11 age group are consistent with those from the 12 to 15 age group, about 7 million children between the ages of 5 and 11 may receive their first vaccine dose within a month and more than 9 million within two months. This would bump the overall vaccination rate in the US up by about 2 percentage points in one month and 3 percentage points in two months., About 54% of parents with children under the age of 12 said that they \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that they would vaccinate their children against Covid-19 \"when a vaccine is authorized and available for their age,\" according to a survey by The Rockefeller Foundation conducted by the RAND Corporation., Florida Covid-19 deaths at all-time high as new cases continue to surge, Florida last week reported more Covid-19 deaths than at any time in the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University data, and hospitalizations are also higher than ever. , The state broke its January record for new daily cases about two weeks ago, and that number has continued to rise to the current average of about 21,534 a day. , Just weeks into the start of the school year for many Florida districts, more than 14,000 Covid-19 cases -- among 11,851 students and 2,610 employees -- have been reported throughout the state\'s 15 largest school districts since the start of the school year, according to a CNN analysis. , Several school districts are defying the governor\'s mask mandate restrictions, requiring masks of all students with no option for parents to decide to opt out of the mandate. , The Orange County school board on Tuesday evening enacted a 60-day mask mandate for all students and staff starting Monday, with only medical reasons accepted for exemptions., St. Johns School District, which includes St. Augustine, on Tuesday announced a mask mandate for all employees and visitors to its schools, but not for its students, for the next 30 days, as Covid-19 cases surge in the area.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/24/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html',1,237),(177,'Covid vaccine much safer than catching the virus, study in Israel finds','A large study involving close to 2 million people in Israel shows the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine slightly raises the risk of heart inflammation, swollen lymph nodes and shingles. But it also finds that Covid-19 infection raises the risk of heart inflammation even more -- plus it raises the risk of blood clots, heart attacks and other deadly events.It\'s the first large study to compare the risks of vaccination versus infection head to head in the same population during the same time, and it shows the risks of infection far outweigh any risks from the vaccine, the researchers said., \"In this study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting, the BNT162b2 vaccine was not associated with an elevated risk of most of the adverse events examined,\"  Dr. Ran Balicer of the Clalit Research Institute in Tel Aviv and colleagues wrote in their report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine., , , They did find extra cases of myocarditis -- a type of heart inflammation that\'s been linked with both of the mRNA vaccines, made by Moderna and Pfizer. It added up to about three extra cases per 100,000 people vaccinated, and was seen almost entirely among young men., \"The main potential adverse events identified included an excess risk of lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph glands), herpes zoster infection (shingles), appendicitis, and myocarditis,\" they wrote., \"To place these risks in context, we also examined data on more than 240,000 infected persons to estimate the effects of a documented SARS CoV-2 infection on the incidence of the same adverse events,\" they added., \"SARS-CoV-2 infection was not estimated to have a meaningful effect on the incidence of lymphadenopathy, herpes zoster infection, or appendicitis, but it was estimated to result in a substantial excess risk of myocarditis.\", Covid-19 infection raised the risk of myocarditis by much more than vaccination did -- about 11 cases per 100,000 people vaccinated, they found., , , They also found some surprises., \"Some initially unexpected effects were seen in the results of the current study. The BNT162b2 vaccine appears to be protective against certain conditions such as anemia and intracranial hemorrhage,\" they wrote. \"These same adverse events are also identified in this study as complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, so it appears likely that the protective effect of the vaccine is mediated through its protection against undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection,\" they added., Dr. Grace Lee, a pediatrician at Stanford University who chairs the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said the findings provide valuable insight., , , \"Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines may be associated with myocarditis, but they can also prevent cases of myocarditis, acute kidney injury, arrhythmia, and thromboembolic disease,\" Lee, who was not involved in the study, wrote in a commentary., \"The key to comparing these risks depends on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to an individual person, and that risk can vary according to place and over time. Given the current state of the global pandemic, however, the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 appears to be inevitable.\", Last June, the US Food and Drug Administration added a warning about risk of myocarditis and a related inflammatory condition called pericarditis to information sheets for the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines., , Doctors say it is important to diagnose the condition quickly but is easily treated and patients recover with little trouble.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/25/health/vaccine-risks-infection-comparison/index.html',1,238),(178,'My son was lucky to get a pediatric ICU bed when he needed one. He shouldn\'t have needed luck','When my husband and I were counting down the days to the birth of our son last year, one of my best friends shared Two weeks ago, I watched as my heart lay helpless in a pediatric ICU bed, hooked up to a tangled array of wires and tubes and lifesaving machinery -- cared for around the clock by a team of dozens of doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists., As the executive producer of CNN Health, I have been responsible for covering -- along with my incredible team -- every development, big and small, in the coronavirus pandemic over the last year and a half. That includes, of course, all the latest news regarding infections, vaccines and masks, but also the secondary ramifications of Covid-19, such as kids falling behind on routine vaccinations, the mental health impact of remote school and work, as well as a vicious resurgence of respiratory viruses as children and adults emerge from their Covid bubbles., Back in June, we reported on a spike in cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) across the South. \"RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms ... but RSV can be serious, especially for infants and older adults,\" according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That same week, we also reported why the upcoming flu season might be more severe., Even as these other common respiratory illnesses skyrocket, we are again averaging more than 150,000 new Covid-19 cases every day in the United States. More than 95,000 Americans are currently hospitalized with Covid-19 -- nearly all of whom are unvaccinated., Covid-19 hospitalization rates among children and adults under age 50 are now the highest they\'ve ever been. And we still don\'t have a Covid-19 vaccine for children younger than 12., What that means: It\'s up to responsible adults and adolescents to get vaccinated against Covid-19 to protect this country\'s children -- to slow the spread of coronavirus, keep in-person learning possible and reserve hospital beds for those who unexpectedly need them by no fault of their own., This is why I\'m sharing my family\'s story -- as a call to action for everyone to make the important decisions that allow us to maintain a safety net that any of us might need at any time., You probably remember last winter, preeminent health experts worried about a \"double whammy\" of Covid-19 and flu resulting in the country\'s hospitals being overwhelmed. But while many hospitals certainly exceeded capacity (and health care workers were run ragged -- physically, mentally and emotionally), the double whammy never bore out. Why? Stay-at-home orders and mask wearing rendered flu virtually non-existent last winter. But this winter, with everyone back out and about, I\'m worried we aren\'t ready., The warning signs, Like many children, my son spent most of the last year at home. But once Covid-19 vaccines became widely available and it seemed like the country was getting a grip on the pandemic a few months ago, we decided to enroll him in daycare. He\'s 16 months old now, and we worried about him missing out on learning in a structured setting, and not having the chance to socialize with other kids. We did our research, toured a few options, and ultimately enrolled him at a daycare with substantive Covid-19 mitigation measures in place -- not to mention a great curriculum., Since he started in June, little man has been beset by constant \"daycare crud\" -- as one of my colleagues calls it -- that many children experience when they first start school. A runny nose, a little cough, an ear infection; some steamy showers, infant ibuprofen, antibiotic prescriptions; we all move on., Indeed, our son did contract RSV his first month at school and recovered just fine. Then three Saturdays ago, he started acting a little funny -- nothing too concerning, he just wasn\'t himself. We were scheduled to leave town on a family vacation the next day, so I took him to the doctor to get checked out before we left. Diagnosis: Probably another ear infection. The pediatrician told us to keep an eye on his symptoms over the next day or two and wrote a prescription for us to fill while we were out of town if we needed it., But Sunday morning, little man barely touched his breakfast -- odd for a kid who usually eats such an unbelievable amount of food that we wonder where in his body it goes. He was fussy, tired, wanted to cuddle during the daytime -- all out of the ordinary. We kept packing the car to leave, hoping he\'d sleep it off on the road, but as we pulled out of the driveway -- literally, before we got to the end of our street -- he threw up, so we turned around and came home., We decided to put him down for a nap, see how he was acting when he got up, and then reevaluate whether or not to hit the road again. When I woke him up, his breathing really concerned me -- he was taking short, shallow breaths. When I went to change his diaper, rather than seeing his belly expand and contract with each breath, it looked like he was sucking in beneath his ribs. I knew from talking to his pediatrician when he was sick with RSV that this was a telltale sign of respiratory distress in children., So, we got back in the car and drove straight to the emergency room at Children\'s Healthcare of Atlanta., Cause for concern, Luckily, we didn\'t have to wait too long to be seen. And as soon as he was evaluated, the sense of urgency escalated even more. Thank God it did. By the time we got back to a room in the ER, little man\'s heart was beating more than 180 beats per minutes (normal for his age is 80-130 BPMs) and he was taking close to 60 breaths per minute (normal for his age is 20-30 breaths per minute). Most concerning: His blood oxygen level was dipping into the low 80s (good is 95% and above; anything below 90% is concerning)., The ER staff got him hooked up to oxygen and tried a few albuterol treatments, which had little to no effect (we learned this was actually good news, because it indicated he didn\'t have undiagnosed asthma).  At that point, the doctor told us our chances of not spending the night in the hospital were 10-15%. What they needed to determine was how much oxygen support he needed, and that would be the deciding factor between admitting him to a \"floor\" (regular) room or the pediatric ICU., While we worked to figure that out, a test for 15 respiratory viruses (including Covid-19) came back positive for two: rhinovirus and parainfluenza. While usually not a big deal, this double whammy resulted in our son developing bronchiolitis -- \"a common lung infection in young children and infants,\" according to the Mayo Clinic. \"Most children get better with care at home. A small percentage of children require hospitalization.\", Thankfully, a chest X-ray came back negative for pneumonia., The low-flow oxygen didn\'t help at all, and we were quickly reaching the upper limits of high-flow oxygen support. Shortly after midnight, the ER staff wheeled us up to the pediatric ICU on a gurney, my son half asleep on my chest., Not all heroes wear capes, We arrived in the ICU to find a team of doctors, nurses and a respiratory therapist waiting for us. I handed my son to them, and they laid him down in a crib to hook him up to a device called a RAM -- basically the most significant form of non-invasive oxygen support before needing to be sedated., Since he was not sedated, he needed to be pinned down and held still while they positioned the cannula in his nose and taped the tubing to his face. A feeding tube also needed to be inserted because you\'re unable to eat while receiving this level of oxygen support., Somewhere amid all screaming and crying, I felt myself about to throw up or pass out, so I stepped to the back of the room to sit down. I knew they were helping him; I just couldn\'t bring myself to watch., Thank God he\'s so young, I thought, that when this is all over, he won\'t remember any of it., Once he had finally settled down and fallen asleep, my husband went to run home and grab our toothbrushes, my contact lens case and -- most importantly -- some toys and books that would help little man feel more comfortable during his hospital stay. We were told to expect to be there a week, based on the typical trajectory of these illnesses. We were also warned that they usually peak between days 3-5, so things could still get worse., I stood over my son\'s bed, machines whirring and beeping next to me, unable to believe where our day had ended up. I was anxious and terrified, but also grateful and at peace, knowing he was receiving care from an extraordinary team of caregivers., Now in the room just the two of us, I started to quietly sing \"Raining Tacos,\" one of my son\'s favorite silly songs: \"It\'s raining tacos / from out of the sky / tacos, no need to ask why / just open your mouth and close your eyes / it\'s raining tacos.\" That\'s as far as I made it before I started sobbing., Would we ever sing and dance to this song again? Would he ever make it out of the ICU? And if he did, would there be any long-term effects of his illness?, What transpired were five excruciating days and nights for all of us: constant poking and prodding, watching and waiting, and -- worst of all -- deep suction every few hours to remove the mucus stuck in his airways, so he could begin to breathe on his own again. And this was for a case that ultimately did not get worse, as doctors suggested it might., Every single person who entered our little one-room universe that week wore a mask and disposable yellow gowns, to protect themselves from contracting a respiratory illness. But while one of the nurses tried to make my son laugh by telling him the gown made her look like Big Bird, I swear it looked more like a superhero cape to me., During my darkest, sleep-deprived moments, I wondered what would\'ve happened had we left for vacation and been driving through rural Georgia when things took a turn for the worse. I wondered if we\'d made a mistake by not bringing him to the hospital a day earlier. And, of course, I questioned whether we made the right decision to send him to daycare, which is almost certainly where he contracted the two viruses that knocked him out., But during my most present, salient moments, I was just grateful -- grateful for the incredible team caring for our son (and us!); grateful for our health insurance and not needing to factor in our ability to pay in deciding to go to the hospital in the first place; and grateful there was an open bed for inpatient treatment., Time for action, During one of my conversations with the hospital staff, they told me they\'re usually super slow this time of year, but instead their ICU was almost at capacity -- in large part because of the unforeseen number of respiratory viruses circulating this season. On the day we were transferred out of the ICU to a regular room to monitor little man one more night while he slept (if oxygen desaturation occurs, it\'s likely going to be during REM sleep), the nurse told us they only had one bed left., I refused to let my mind go to the place if my son had been this sick and couldn\'t receive the care he needed because hospitals were overrun with Covid patients. But around the country, some families are already living this nightmare scenario. The week my son was hospitalized, Dallas County, Texas had zero remaining ICU beds for children., Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins laid out the consequences in no uncertain terms: \"That means if your child\'s in a car wreck, if your child has a congenital heart defect or something and needs an ICU bed, or more likely if they have Covid and need an ICU bed, we don\'t have one. Your child will wait for another child to die.\", At the beginning of this week, five states were at more than 90% ICU capacity. Georgia, where we live, is third worst: 94% full statewide. Children\'s Healthcare of Atlanta says they\'re seeing more Covid-positive children now than at any other point during the pandemic., The national data bears this out. The American Academy of Pediatrics said last week that more than 120,000 Covid-19 cases were reported the previous week, and that child cases have \"steadily increased\" since the beginning of July., And on Thursday, at a news conference with leaders from metro Atlanta hospitals, Dr. Jim Fortenberry, chief medical officer of Children\'s Healthcare of Atlanta, said he supports in-person learning but also supports universal mask wearing, regardless of vaccination status., \"We owe it to our kids to do everything to protect them,\" he said., This is why I am so bewildered but also furious when I read about governors banning mask mandates -- something science tells us would serve as another important layer of protection against coronavirus, and also against other surging respiratory viruses., Here in Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp last week signed an executive order allowing businesses to disregard local Covid-19 ordinances, including masking., This is simply inexcusable. In the early weeks -- and even months -- of the pandemic, it would\'ve been understandable if we and our leaders didn\'t make all the right decisions for our health. We didn\'t have the science then, but now we do., Research has shown that the Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and masks are another important strategy to snuff out a virus that is still transmitting at \"high\" and \"substantial\" levels in more than 95% of US counties., Children across the country are getting infected with the coronavirus in greater numbers not because the Delta variant specifically targets them. It\'s because young children are not eligible to be vaccinated, and the virus is looking for a new host., But still, less than two-thirds of eligible Americans (people age 12 and older) have gotten vaccinated, so we never got our community immunity levels where they needed to be. Put simply: We\'ve failed our children., The virus doesn\'t care if someone is unvaccinated because they\'ve made that choice or because they\'re not yet eligible. That this wave is beginning to rival previous waves, when there were no vaccines, is unforgivable., There are only so many hospital beds available, and adults and children alike need care for things other than Covid-19 -- which can be prevented with a free, widely available vaccine., Heart disease and cancer are still the leading causes of death in this country. Those patients deserve treatment. People who get in an accident, by no fault of their own, deserve treatment. The infinitesimally small number of people who did everything right yet experience serious breakthrough Covid-19 infections deserve treatment., And my son, who got sick because his immune system hasn\'t fully developed yet, deserved treatment. Thankfully, he got it and has fully recovered, but I\'m sharing our family\'s story because it is my sincerest hope that no parent or child ever finds themselves in the circumstance of needing care and not being able to get it because of the poor decisions of others., We\'ve made the same mistakes too many times throughout this pandemic, but tomorrow can be different. Tomorrow needs to be different -- not only for ourselves, but for our kids., Thankfully, we know the ways out of this nightmare: Wear a mask and get vaccinated.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/24/health/covid-hospitalizations-commentary/index.html',1,240),(179,'As hospitalization rates soar, FDA grants full approval to Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine ','As Americans face a daunting The approval could help allay concerns for those who are vaccine hesitant, as all three vaccines available in the US have so far been distributed under emergency use authorization., It could also help businesses, schools and states enforce vaccine mandates, experts have said. Such mandates could help quell the ever-growing number of cases, especially in states that are experiencing a lack of available ICU beds., \"It\'s an important step because it makes mandates easier, and it will address concerns of some of the people who have been on the fence about getting vaccinated,\" former CDC director Tom Frieden told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer on Monday., Some universities and employers have issued mandates, including hospital systems, and the FDA approval is already accelerating that trend. On Monday, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that all education department staff in public schools across the city must be vaccinated. That makes New York the largest school system in the country to have such a mandate. , The US military also will now require all service members to be vaccinated, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said Monday. , And in New Jersey, all state employees must be fully vaccinated by October 18 or be subject to regular testing, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday. , The number of vaccine doses administered daily has mostly increased over the past week -- with three days surpassing a million reported doses, according to data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, the daily average of new reported cases is around 147,000, and experts have warned it could surpass 200,000 on the current trajectory., Vaccination is key to controlling the virus, About 171 million Americans, 51.5% of the population, were fully vaccinated as of Monday, CDC data show, while 60.8% have received at least one dose. A total of 25 states have fully vaccinated more than half of their residents, with Michigan the latest state to do so, according to CDC data., Some health experts, such as Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccinologist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, say the US needs to have at least 80% of its population vaccinated to get the virus under control., \"If we\'re going to halt this virus transmission, we\'re going to have to get to 80-85%,\" Hotez told CNN\'s Jake Tapper Monday. And while the FDA approval may help convince a few people to get vaccinated, he said, mandates will be more helpful in reaching the goal. , \"I think the bigger impact, as was mentioned, is going to be around mandates, employer mandates, federal mandates, from the military,\" Hotez said., Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Monday that if the majority of the population gets vaccinated, the US could regain control of the virus by the spring of 2022., Fauci said he misspoke when he told NPR earlier on Monday that it would be the fall of 2022., \"If we can get through this winter and get really the majority -- overwhelming majority -- of the 90 million people who have not been vaccinated, vaccinated, I hope we can start to get some good control in the spring of 2022,\" Fauci told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper., Fauci said that includes vaccinating people who have contracted and recovered from Covid-19, who could stand to gain \"an enormous increase in the degree of protection,\" from the vaccine., \"As we get into the spring, we could start getting back to a degree of normality, namely reassuming the things that we were hoping we could do -- restaurants, theaters, that kind of thing,\" he said., Fauci said it\'s not yet clear what percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated for the US to gain control over the virus., \"You know how you\'re going to know? Just get as many people vaccinated as you possibly can, and when you get control, that\'ll be the number,\" Fauci said., But in many states with lower vaccination rates, hospitals have been overwhelmed by a surge in Covid-19 patients., In Mississippi, where 36.8% of the population is fully vaccinated, Gov. Tate Reeves said Sunday that a 23-person active-duty military Covid-19 response team was deployed in Jackson to provide supplemental medical staffing at hospitals. A second team is expected to arrive in Tupelo in the next week., An uptick in cases among school-age children following the return to in-person learning has also worried health officials, with thousands of kids quarantined over the past week due to Covid-19 outbreaks. Experts have stressed that to protect those under 12 who can\'t get vaccinated yet, it\'s important to make sure those who are eligible get the shot. Another key prevention method is wearing a mask., Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told CBS\' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that warning signs for what could happen nationwide in the coming weeks have already been seen in the South., \"Schools open earlier in the South, against the backdrop of still a lot of prevalence (of Delta) and the infection is getting into schools, and it\'s proving to be hard to control in schools,\" Gottlieb explained. \"Delta is a very contagious variant and so I think that this is a harbinger of the challenges that we\'re going to face nationally as schools reopen.\", How to keep schools open and children safe, While districts continue to return to in-person learning, a debate is brewing between districts, parents and local officials on how to make the safest return to classrooms., In Texas and Florida, governors have threatened to pull funding from districts that create mask mandates, but several local school boards are pushing back and telling students to mask up. , In Texas, where the issue is working its way through the courts, one district managed to get around official orders by making the mask mandate part of its school uniform policy., In Florida, nearly 20,000 students and staff members had to be quarantined after more than 6,000 covid cases were identified among the state\'s 15 largest school districts since the start of school, according to a CNN analysis conducted last week. Among those, were 4,641 students and 1,547 employees who tested positive. That doesn\'t include the two biggest school districts in the state, Miami-Dade and Broward., While the number of cases has been rising amid the return to school, Gottlieb said it\'s hard to assess if that is because the Delta variant itself is more aggressive in children or because we are simply exposing more kids to the virus., He said schools should be following the lead of some districts in North Dakota, where schools are testing close contacts every few days to make sure asymptomatic cases aren\'t going undiagnosed. , \"Test the close contact of kids immediately to make sure there\'s not other asymptomatic cases that are going undiagnosed, and then test them at some kind of interval, maybe three days and five days to make sure that there\'s not an outbreak being triggered in the school,\" Gottlieb told CBS., US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy echoed the importance of keeping children safe amid the rise in pediatric cases., \"It\'s our moral responsibility as a society to do everything we can to protect our children,\" he told ABC\'s \"This Week\" on Sunday. \"Number one, all of us getting vaccinated as adults is important. Kids too young to get vaccinated rely on those around them to shield them from the virus.\", Vaccine boosters up for consideration, While vaccination rates still lag in the US, those who are already vaccinated are weighing the need for booster shots., Starting September 20, those who are eight months out from their second dose of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine will be eligible to receive a booster, if FDA authorizes them and the CDC recommends them., And those who received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine will also likely need a booster, according to Murthy. , \"We believe that J&amp;J recipients will likely need a booster but we are waiting on some data from the company about a second dose,\" Murthy said on CNN\'s \"State of the Union\" Sunday., So far, only Pfizer has submitted initial booster data to the FDA; the company said Phase 3 results evaluating the third dose are expected shortly., At the same time it\'s considering boosters, the FDA has been working with Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson towards full approval -- a process known as Biologics License Application or BLA., Clarification: This story has been updated with Fauci\'s clarification that the US could have control over Covid-19 entering spring 2022 if most eligible people get vaccinated.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/23/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html',1,241),(180,'Between flu and Covid-19, winter \'could be complicated\' ','If there ever was a year to get a flu shot, this one may be it.Typically, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests people get a flu shot by the end of October., But the coming flu season may be a bad one. With Covid-19 still complicating things,  the experts say you may want to do it even earlier. , \"Years ago, we would say you should wait as long as you can to get a shot, but if you get it in the fall, that really should cover you through the season,\" said Dr. Claudia Hoyen, director of pediatric infection control at UH Rainbow Babies and Children\'s Hospital in Cleveland. \"If people get the chance to go ahead and get their flu shot, whenever they can do it is probably good.\", Based on the number of viruses she\'s seen hitting people early this year, she thinks it doesn\'t bode well for the flu season. Hoyen\'s children\'s hospital has been much busier this summer compared to last, treating children for a bigger mix of viruses., \"Once we all took our masks off, the viruses did what they do best and found lots of people to give runny noses to,\" Hoyen said. , What the flu season will look like this year, The US isn\'t seeing a lot of influenza yet, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but that could soon change., To predict what kind of flu numbers the US should expect, experts often look to the Southern hemisphere, where flu season usually starts in June and peaks in August. , , \"The story is mixed so far,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center., Australia, with its tight pandemic restrictions on travelers coming into the country, has had very low flu activity, Schaffner said. , \"But China, which has more interactions with the outer world, has had a moderate flu season,\" Schaffner said. , \"So we think we\'ll have at least a moderate season this year.\", Children the \'distribution franchise\' for flu, Typically what kicks off the flu season is the start of the school year. With more kids going back to the classroom than last year, unless kids are wearing masks, and everyone else for that matter, there will likely be more cases, he said., \"Children are the \'distribution franchise\' for the influenza virus. They\'re on top of each other and they are not the most hygienic little lovelies, so they spread the flu virus amongst themselves,\" said Schaffner. , \"When kids get infected, they shed the virus for a longer period of time than adults do, so they\'re really the people who bring the virus into the family and spread it about to the neighbors and, well, everybody,\" Schaffner said. , Flu by the numbers, In an average season, the US sees between 9 and 45 million cases of the flu each year, according to the CDC. , , Last year was no average season. Flu was practically non-existent in the US with only a few thousand cases for the entire year. One child died. For comparison, in 2019-2020, there were 199 flu-related deaths in children and 144 the season before that. , The \"twindemic\" with a high number of flu and Covid-19 cases that some experts predicted for 2020 thankfully never happened., What\'s different this year, What may have helped are the extra precautions people took to stop the spread of Covid-19. , Masks, good hand hygiene, limited in-person school, restricted travel and less interaction with others can help prevent Covid-19 and the spread of the flu. , As the country has opened back up, protection from a flu shot therefore becomes even more essential for just about everyone. , A person can get a flu shot and a Covid-19 vaccine at the same time, so if they haven\'t been vaccinated against Covid-19 yet, or they need a booster, there are no real medical reasons to space them apart from a flu shot, Schaffner said, \"If it\'s your opportunity to get both, I would say get both,\" Schaffner said. Of course, children 11 and younger cannot be vaccinated against Covid-19 yet., , Flu shots are already available at pharmacies like CVS and Walgreen\'s., An added motivation to get a flu shot, While Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper Monday that the United States could get back to a \"degree of normality\" by spring of 2022 if the majority unvaccinated in this country get the Covid-19 vaccine, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases noted that getting through the winter \"could be complicated\" by the flu., Getting vaccinated could certainly keep those numbers to a minimum and with Covid-19 in circulation, Hoyen said people have an added incentive to get a flu shot this year. , Kids under 12 still can\'t get a Covid-19 vaccine, and while the disease can be milder in the little ones, Hoyen said hospitals are seeing more children with Covid-19 and another virus., , \"Even if we don\'t think these things are important for ourselves, we should really do them for a child in our lives so that they can get back to a little more normal,\" Hoyen said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/24/health/flu-covid-winter-wellness/index.html',1,243),(181,'Next up for Covid vaccines: kids under 12','The US Food and Drug Administration has \"I don\'t think it\'ll be long before they extend it to 12 to 15 -- maybe within a few weeks to a month or so,\" said Dr. Bob Frenck, director of the Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children\'s Hospital., Parents are already clamoring to hear more about approval or authorization for children under 12, however. Studies looking at that are underway., It appears that kids can get a much smaller dose of vaccine than adults and still get the same immune response, Frenck told CNN., That\'s good news, because it means vaccine supply can be stretched further, Frenck said., \"We took a step back after we did the adolescents, and we looked at the dosing, because we thought that we may be able to use a lower dose and be able to get the same immune response,\" Frenck said., It looks like children ages 5-12 get a strong immune response with 10 micrograms of vaccine antigen, Frenck said., \"So one third of the dose that we\'re giving adults, or even one third of the dose that was used in 12-year-olds and above, was just as immunogenic. We got just as good an immune response as the 30-microgram dose and there were less side effects,\" he said., \"So because of that, for the 5-12-year-old dosing we are looking at 10 micrograms, and then, in the younger kids, under 5, even going down further to 3 micrograms.\", That might be confusing, but it simply means children have a stronger immune response, Frenck said. \"It just really proves as far as that the kids\' immune responses are good. They\'re very strong,\" he said., \"A lot of people are asking us: \'Does this mean you\'re giving us less of a vaccine?\' I said, well, we\'re giving you less antigen, but their immune response is so good that they\'re making the same immune response -- so there\'s no need to give more vaccine,\" Frenck added., \"We\'re giving enough vaccine to be able to get the same immune response as we\'re seeing in people 25 years of age that are getting 30 micrograms.\", More is not better, Frenck said -- the immune response hits a maximum and giving a higher dose doesn\'t boost it., \"We were able to decrease by a third, and still got the same immune response,\" he said., As with adults, side effects are generally mild and do not last long, Frenck said., \"The side effects we\'re seeing in the kids are really identical to what we\'re seeing in adults,\" Frenck said. That includes a sore arm, fatigue, headache and fever in about 10% of children, he said., Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he was confident the trials would show good efficacy among younger children.,  \"I don\'t think there\'s going to be any question that this is going to be effective in the children at that younger age. I have no doubt about that,\" Fauci told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper Monday evening., Dr. Amanda Dropic, a pediatrician in Florence, Kentucky, enrolled her four children in the trials for various ages at Cincinnati Children\'s., \"I talked to my kids about it. We all agreed that in order for everybody to get vaccinated, somebody has to be willing to step up and go first,\" she said in a video released by the hospital., \"We miss traveling. We miss vacations. We miss concerts. We miss sports activities. So hopefully as our kids are vaccinated and then other people get vaccinated, it\'ll really help,\" Dropic said., \"I am just really looking forward to hanging out with friends ... going to places without worrying about masks or where I can eat,\" said Dropic\'s son, Ben, now 16, who took part in the trial for Pfizer\'s vaccine in the 12-15-year-old age group., \"It is important to get the vaccine so you stop the spread of coronavirus and so the virus won\'t hurt any more people,\" said Ben\'s younger brother Eli, 10., Frenck\'s team is starting vaccine trials now testing Moderna\'s Covid-19 vaccine in kids under 12. The hospital is due to enroll 75 children, he said -- 25 in each age group: 6-12, 2-6 and infants to age 2., As with all the coronavirus vaccine trials, investigators like Frenck are speeding up the bureaucratic steps for submitting vaccine data to move the process along more quickly., \"Typically what happens is that you get a result from a Phase 1 (trial) and then you\'re showing it back to the company and saying, \'Okay, is this good enough that we\'re going to go to a Phase 2,\' and then having to think about it. And then you same thing with Phase 2 to Phase 3.  Here it just marched right along because the funding was already available,\" he said., Often a study lasts four or five years, and the researchers gather all the data up at the end of that period of study and submit it to the FDA. \"So you can imagine getting four or five years\' worth of data all at one time -- that\'s a lot to try to process,\" he said., \"What happened here was that the FDA was being given packets of information in real time. As the companies got the information, it\'s being submitted to the FDA for them to review so when they got to a point in time of looking at the emergency use authorization, the FDA was already very familiar with the products and they didn\'t have to start from ground zero.\", Moderna is also considering lower doses in younger children, Frenck said., Pfizer says it will apply to the FDA for authorization to use its vaccines in children ages 5-11 by the end of September, once it sends all the data in., Moderna, whose vaccine is authorized for people 18 and older, has filed with for EUA for children 12-17.

It would not be appropriate.\", Meanwhile, the FDA and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) both strongly recommend that all eligible adolescents, ages 12 to 17, be vaccinated as soon as possible, especially as the highly transmissible Delta coronavirus variant continues to circulate nationwide., As of last week, the AAP reports 180,000 new cases of Covid-19 among children and adolescents, according to the Academy. , So far, about 8.5 million or 34% of all adolescents ages 12 to 17 are fully vaccinated against Covid-19., \'Not just small adults\', It\'s clear many parents are eager to get younger children vaccinated, but FDA\'s Woodcock said that children \"are not just small adults.\" , \"We really would have to have the data and the appropriate dose before recommending that children be vaccinated,\" Woodcock added on Monday., The AAP also \"strongly discourages\" using the vaccine off-label in children younger than 12, noting that the dose of the adult vaccine is much higher than the doses being tested in young children., \"The clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccine in children ages 11 years old and younger are underway, and we need to see the data from those studies before we give this vaccine to younger children,\" AAP President Dr. Lee Savio Beers said in a statement on Monday, following the FDA\'s approval. , \"The dose may be different for younger ages,\" Beers said. \"The AAP recommends against giving the vaccine to children under 12 until authorized by the FDA.\", Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, also urged physicians to wait until clinical trials are complete in young children before giving the vaccine to those under 12., \"We do not want individual physicians to be calculating doses and dosing schedules one-by-one for younger children based on the experience with the vaccine in older patients,\" Maldonado said in a statement on Monday. , \"We should do this based on all of the evidence for each age group, and for that we need the trials to be completed. I know parents are anxious to protect their children, but we want to make sure children have the full benefit of ongoing clinical trials.\", Covid-19 vaccine trials underway in younger children, In a letter sent to Woodcock earlier this month, the AAP called on the FDA to work aggressively to authorize a vaccine for children younger than 12. , Pfizer has said it expects to have vaccine trial data on children ages 5 to 11 by the end of September, and the company could apply to have its vaccine authorized for those younger ages shortly after. The company also has said data for even younger children, ages 2 to 5, could be available shortly after., Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson are also working on studies in children., Last month, the FDA asked Pfizer and Moderna to double the number of children ages 5 to 11 in clinical trials. The FDA also asked for six months of follow-up safety data, instead of the two months it asked for with adults., \"We know parents are eager to be able to give their children the protection of this vaccine, and the American Academy of Pediatrics shares that feeling of urgency,\" Beers said on Monday. \"The Delta variant has led to significant increases in the number of children and adults infected with the virus. While we wait for a vaccine to be authorized for younger children, it\'s important that everyone who is eligible now get the vaccine. That will help reduce the spread of the virus and protect those who are too young to be vaccinated.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/23/health/covid-19-vaccine-off-label-children-fda-bn/index.html',1,249),(183,'From increased hospitalizations to long Covid, children can get hit hard by Covid-19. Here\'s why doctors say kids should be protected','The myth that kids can\'t get seriously sick from Covid-19 keeps getting debunked as more children get hospitalized during More than 49,000 children have been hospitalized with Covid-19 since August 2020, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. , This month, an average of 276 children were getting hospitalized with Covid-19 every day between August 14 and 20, CDC data shows. , \"Half of the children that we\'ve admitted have been under the age of 2,\" Dr. Mark Kline, physician-in-chief of Children\'s Hospital New Orleans, said this month., \"This virus that we\'re dealing with now is a game changer. And it\'s just so easily transmitted from person-to-person.\", Now doctors say it\'s crucial to protect children against the Delta variant -- not just for the sake of their health and to keep in-person learning, but also to help prevent more aggressive variants from emerging., , Almost half of children hospitalized with Covid-19 had no known underlying condition, Much has changed since the last school year. A more contagious variant -- Alpha -- has been replaced by an even more contagious variant -- Delta -- as the dominant strain of coronavirus in the US. , In just two months, Delta jumped from 3% to more than 93% of sequenced coronavirus samples in the US, the CDC said., And the weekly count of children newly infected with Covid-19 has more than tripled in less than a month., About 39,000 new cases were reported during the week ending July 21, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. , That number soared to 121,427 new cases during the week ending August 12, the AAP said., Among children getting hospitalized with Covid-19, many were previously healthy., Almost half -- 46.4% -- of children hospitalized with Covid-19 between March 2020 and June 2021 had no known underlying condition, according to CDC data from almost 100 US counties. , Covid-19 deaths in children shouldn\'t be ignored, CDC chief says, While children are far less likely to die from Covid-19 than adults, the deaths are still significant, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said. , At least 471 US children have died from Covid-19, according to CDC data. For the 2019-20 flu season, the CDC reported 199 confirmed pediatric flu deaths and an estimated 434 pediatric flu deaths., One reason why Covid-19 is deadlier for children than other infectious diseases is because many children are vaccinated against other diseases, said Dr. James Campbell, professor of pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine., \"Nobody\'s dying of polio, nobody\'s dying of measles in the United States. Nobody\'s dying of diphtheria,\" Campbell told CNN last month., But while children ages 12 to 17 can get a Covid-19 vaccine, many have not done so. And it could be several more months before a vaccine is authorized for children under age 12. , Rebecca Calloway\'s 7-year-old daughter Georgia is one of thousands of young children testing various doses of Covid-19 vaccines to make sure they\'re safe and effective before they get authorized. , Part of why Calloway enrolled Georgia in the pediatric vaccine trial is because she recently lost her 3-year-old daughter to another unexpected disease -- Type 1 diabetes -- and doesn\'t want any more families to lose a child to Covid-19., While childhood deaths from Covid-19 and Type 1 diabetes are rare, \"You don\'t want to be that statistic,\" Calloway said. , Protecting kids from Covid-19 is critical to keep them in schools, With the highly contagious Delta variant, the CDC recommends students from kindergarten through grade 12 wear masks in school, along with teachers and visitors. , The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends masks in schools for everyone over age 2. , \"Our children deserve to have full-time, in person, safe learning with prevention measures in place. And that includes masking for everyone in schools,\" Walensky said. , Some students are returning to schools for the first time in a year. But long-awaited classroom learning can be quickly derailed by an infection or outbreak. , In Mississippi and Florida, thousands of students just starting their school year have already had to quarantine. , And it doesn\'t take much for Covid-19 to shut down a school again. Even one case can have a ripple effect on students, faculty and staff. , \"We need adults to run schools, and if my adults are sick or needing to quarantine, I don\'t have adults present to provide the education,\" said Carlee Simon, superintendent of Alachua County Public Schools in Florida. , The school board voted to require face masks for the first two weeks of school, but Florida\'s governor has threatened to reduce funding to schools that require masks. , And that has the superintendent worried. , \"When we have families that don\'t want to have masks on their child, what they\'re doing is not only (increasing the) chance they will have to be quarantined,\" Simon said. , If a student gets infected, \"they will also have other students who did have masks on who would also need to be quarantined.\" , \"Everybody wants to move forward. Nobody wants to have masks forever,\" Simon said. But \"we would like to be able to be safe and have instructional time with our students.\", In addition to masks in schools, the CDC recommends layering other strategies such as improved ventilation, physical distancing and testing on a screening basis., MIS-C and long Covid can leave lasting impacts, Long-term Covid-19 complications can be significant for children and adolescents -- even for some who initially had mild or no symptoms, the American Academy of Pediatrics said., All pediatric patients who tested positive should have at least one follow-up exam with a pediatrician, the AAP said. , Pediatricians should watch out for residual or long-term Covid-19 problems such as respiratory symptoms, which can last three months or more; heart issues, including a type of heart inflammation known as myocarditis; cognitive problems such as \"brain fog\"; headache; fatigue and mental health issues, the AAP said., Children who had moderate or severe Covid-19 may be at greater risk for subsequent heart disease, the pediatrician group said., In some cases, children who start with mild or even no symptoms from Covid-19 end up hospitalized weeks or months later with a condition called MIS-C -- multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children., MIS-C is \"a rare but serious condition associated with COVID-19 in which different body parts become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs,\" the CDC says., It happens when \"the virus induces your body to make an immune response against your own blood vessels\" -- which can cause inflammation of the blood vessels, said pediatrician Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\'s Hospital in Philadelphia., Often, children with MIS-C don\'t start off very sick with Covid-19., \"Usually children are picked up incidentally as having (coronavirus). Someone in the family was infected, a friend was infected, so they got a PCR test. And they\'re found to be positive. ... Then they\'re fine,\" Offit told CNN., \"Then a month goes by, and they develop a high fever. And evidence of lung, liver, kidney or heart damage. That\'s when they come to our hospital.\", At least 4,404 cases of MIS-C had been reported between February 2020 and July 2021, including 37 deaths, the CDC said. , It said 99% of MIS-C patients had tested positive for coronavirus, and the other 1% had contact with someone with Covid-19. , The median age of patients with MIS-C was 9 years old. , \"CDC is working to learn more about why some children and adolescents develop MIS-C after having COVID-19 or contact with someone with COVID-19, while others do not,\" the CDC says. , \"Based on what we know now about MIS-C, the best way you can protect your child is by taking everyday actions to prevent your child and the entire household from getting the virus that causes COVID-19.\", The best steps parents can take to protect their children include getting vaccinated and vaccinating children ages 12 and up, Walensky said., And even if a parent is fully vaccinated, there\'s a small chance they could catch an asymptomatic breakthrough infection and pass the virus to their children., That\'s why it\'s a good idea for all parents of young children to wear masks in public indoor settings. , But the best way to protect unvaccinated children, Walensky said, \"is to surround them with vaccinated people.\", Children can accidentally help spur new variants , Protecting children from getting Covid-19 can help everyone in the long run, doctors say., As coronavirus keeps spreading, replicating itself in new people, the more chances it has to mutate -- potentially leading to even more contagious variants or one that might evade vaccines. , \"That\'s, of course, the concern,\" Walensky said. , Fully vaccinated people are less likely to get infected with the Delta variant. , But unvaccinated people -- including unvaccinated children -- are more susceptible to infection. And they can unknowingly help with the creation of new variants, Offit said. , \"If we are going to continue to allow this virus to spread, we\'re going to continue to allow these variants to be created,\" he said. , \"We\'re not going to be able to stop this pandemic until we have a significant percentage of the population vaccinated.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/07/health/children-covid-19-protection/index.html',1,252),(184,'FDA grants full approval to Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, opening door to more vaccine mandates','The US Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted full approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for people age 16 and older. This is the first coronavirus vaccine approved by the FDA, and is expected to open the door to more vaccine mandates.The vaccine will be marketed as Comirnaty, the FDA said in its announcement on Monday. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been authorized for emergency use in the United States since mid-December for people age 16 and older, and in May, the authorization was extended to those 12 and older., \"The vaccine also continues to be available under emergency use authorization (EUA), including for individuals 12 through 15 years of age and for the administration of a third dose in certain immunocompromised individuals,\" according to the FDA., Out of more than 170 million people in the United States fully vaccinated against Covid-19, more than 92 million have received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine., \"While this and other vaccines have met the FDA\'s rigorous scientific standards for emergency use authorization, as the first FDA approved Covid-19 vaccine, the public can be confident that this vaccine meets the FDA\'s gold standard for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality that we require for an approved product,\" FDA Acting Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said during a briefing on Monday, calling the approval \"a pivotal moment\" for the United States\' fight against the coronavirus pandemic., \"Health care providers can continue to use the vaccine on their shelves,\" Woodcock added. \"The FDA-approved vaccine and the EUA-authorized vaccine have the same formulation and can be used interchangeably to provide the Covid-19 vaccine series.\", Agency official said Monday they hope approval will push unvaccinated people to get vaccinated. US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said on CNN\'s State of the Union on Sunday that approval could encourage individuals to act, and more mandates., \"For businesses and universities that have been thinking about putting vaccine requirements in place in order to create safer spaces for people to work and learn, I think that this move from the FDA, when it comes, will actually help them to move forward with those kinds of plans,\" Murthy told CNN\'s Brianna Keilar., Murthy also noted \"a small number of people\" have been waiting for full approval before getting their shot and believes \"this may tip them over toward getting vaccinated.\", Why emergency use authorization came first, Due to the seriousness of the pandemic, vaccine makers originally applied for emergency use authorizations because the authorization process takes less time than what\'s required for full approval. , In July, drugmaker Pfizer announced that the FDA granted its vaccine a priority review, and the FDA had been pulling in extra help from across the agency to speed final approval of the vaccine., The FDA worked around the clock and conducted its own analyses of the vaccine in addition to the companies\' analyses, Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA\'s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said during Monday\'s briefing., \"We also did benefit-risk assessments based on real-world data that has emerged since the vaccine has now been used in hundreds of millions of people globally. And so that actually takes a lot of work,\" Marks said, adding that the agency also inspected facilities that make the product., It has been 97 days since Pfizer completed the rolling submission of its biologic license application, he said, which means the FDA completed the approval process \"in about 40%\" of the time it would normally take for an approval application submission of this magnitude., Emergency use authorization is what its name suggests -- a medical product, such as a vaccine, that gets special FDA authorization to be used during an emergency. When the health emergency is over, \"then any EUA(s) issued based on that declaration will no longer remain in effect,\" according to the FDA., Among the two other coronavirus vaccines authorized for emergency use in the United States, Moderna has begun applying for full approval for its Covid-19 vaccine in people ages 18 and up. Johnson &amp; Johnson has not yet filed for full FDA approval of its vaccine., Some experts have pushed the FDA to approve vaccines quickly, as doing so could help combat vaccine hesitancy. , Full approval of the Covid-19 shots comes days after the Biden administration announced plans to offer booster doses to vaccinated adults starting September 20 -- pending approval by the FDA and recommendation from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., FDA approval could fight vaccine hesitancy, experts say, Progressing from authorized to approved would allow manufacturers to market and directly distribute their vaccines -- and perhaps sway skeptics hesitant to get the vaccines now., A Kaiser Family Foundation survey of US adults released in July found that among the one-third of adults surveyed who are not yet vaccinated, 16% said the vaccine was too new, too unknown or not tested enough. , Some said in this poll that they wouldn\'t get a vaccine until it is required. While companies are allowed to require the vaccine -- and many large businesses, such as United Airlines, Disney, Walmart, Microsoft, Google and Facebook already have announced plans to do so -- some experts believe more will make it a requirement once a vaccine is fully approved., The Pentagon plans to make the vaccine mandatory for all active duty members of the US military by the middle of September, or sooner, based on approval timing, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a memo released earlier this month., \"I want you to know that I will seek the President\'s approval to make the vaccines mandatory no later than mid-September, or immediately upon the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure, whichever comes first,\" the memo states. , Full FDA approval may also mean big changes in terms of vaccine requirements for staff and students in schools., For instance, in Ohio, a House bill signed into law in July states that a public school or state institution of higher education shall not \"require an individual to receive a vaccine for which the United States Food and Drug Administration has not granted full approval.\", Across all 50 states, at least five routine childhood vaccines are generally required for children attending childcare or school, including those for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus or DTaP, chickenpox, poliio and MMR. But those shots have all been fully approved by the FDA., \"Covid-19 is a little bit different from these other vaccines because of the way it had to be developed,\" Hemi Tewarson, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy, told CNN in July., \"That is a difference, I think, in some people\'s minds who have concerns around potential side effects for children,\" Tewarson said, noting that clinical trials for the EUA for children 12 and older were robust, and there were not significant side effects., But full FDA approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is for people age 16 and older -- it\'s not yet available for all ages., What does approval mean for kids?, As of now, the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is still only available for ages 12 and older in the United States., , Pfizer has said it expects to have vaccine trial data on children ages 5 to 11 by the end of September, and the company could apply to have its vaccine authorized for those younger ages shortly after. The company also has said data for even younger children, ages 2 to 5, could be available shortly after., Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson are also working on studies in children., Even though the FDA has approved the Pfizer/BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine for people age 16 and older, the agency emphasizes that this does not mean the vaccine can be used \"off-label\" in children younger than 12. Off-label refers to an approved product being used in a way or in a patient that it wasn\'t necessarily approved for. , , \"We want to reiterate, it is important that the unvaccinated get vaccinated where it is indicated, but we do not have data on the proper dose nor do we have full data on the safety in children younger than what is in the EUA,\" FDA\'s Woodcock said during Monday\'s briefing call., \"So that would be a great concern that people would vaccinate children because we don\'t have the proper dose and we don\'t have the safety data, nor do we have all the efficacy data, as well,\" Woodcock said. \"We are not recommending that children younger than age 12 be vaccinated with this vaccine.

Mott Children\'s Hospital National Poll on Children\'s Health published Monday. , The survey and report are based on responses researchers collected in June 2021 from 1,669 US-based parents with at least one child between ages 7 and 18. , The pandemic left a mark on students, The pandemic \"wreaked havoc on many families\' school experience last year, with parents and kids navigating unpredictable changes in the learning environment and new social, emotional and academic challenges,\" said Mott Poll codirector Sarah Clark, a research scientist in pediatrics at the University of Michigan, in a news release. , \"Our report suggests that those experiences left a mark on students and families, influencing their views and concerns about the upcoming school year.\", , , , More than a third of parents said at least one of four factors -- academic performance, connections with teachers, relationships with other students and general attitude toward school -- was better for their child from 2020-2021 when compared with the previous school year. , Yet 56% of parents rated at least one of these aspects as worse for their child last year than in 2019-2020, especially if most of 2020-2021 was done virtually. Parents also said helping their children was made difficult because of factors that included their own stress, children\'s stress and uncertainty about e-learning. , School should be considered essential , \"Children learn from in-person interactions and in relationships. When that is taken away with no sense of when it\'s going to be restored, that\'s extremely challenging for anyone, but especially for children,\" said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. , \"In-person, full-time instruction needs to be understood as essential, which is why we need to work on reducing risk during this essential activity,\" Wen said. \"No one would question that these data are reflective on reality, because this is the lived reality for so many people.\"  , The poll also reflected a challenge some parents are facing in terms of balancing safety concerns and priorities regarding social and educational development., Although more than half of parents want to know how many students and teachers aren\'t vaccinated, only 19% of parents said details on students\' and teachers\' vaccination status would affect their decisions regarding whether their child attends in-person school. , , , This seeming contradiction goes back to schools being essential, Wen said. , \"If you have something that people perceive as being essential, even if one of the ideal safety metrics is not met, they will still do it -- not because it\'s safe, but because it\'s essential,\" Wen said. , Covid-19 vaccination of school personnel and other precautions are \"extremely important,\" she added, \"but just because we don\'t have them all, doesn\'t mean that we\'re not going to send our kids to in-person school.\" , \"Parents may also believe that they can minimize that risk by having their child get a Covid vaccine,\" Clark said. , Despite ongoing pandemic concerns, not all the poll\'s findings were negative. Some 41% of parents reported their child is more enthusiastic about this school year, 16% answered less enthusiasm and 43% said the same excitement as the last year. And around half of parents feel confident they can help their child with school, resilience through difficulties or peer problems. , Fears of the unforeseen and how to cope , Spurring the worries about a possible return to virtual learning were some families\' barriers to obtaining technology and/or creating a functioning, comfortable learning environment during the last school year, according to the report. , \"For some children, the decreased level of interaction with teachers also required more supervision or assistance from parents throughout the school day -- which could be especially challenging for those working from home themselves,\" Clark said.  , With Covid-19 cases surging in many parts of the US, the report said, parents should consider helping their child emotionally and logistically prepare for a sudden return to e-learning -- one method could be devising a plan based on what did and didn\'t work last year. , , , For children stressed about safety risks, parents should learn what precautions the school has in place, then discuss them together, the researchers suggested. , Families can also discuss how children might navigate moments when lots of students might be crowded together during lunch or class changes. If kids had trouble with certain subjects last year, parents can ask teachers for advice on how their child can catch up via supplementary work or a tutor\'s help. , Additionally, \"some children and teens who may have avoided social anxieties or conflicts during virtual school may also need support transitioning back to traditional in-person school,\" Clark said. , For children worried about making friends, parents could try to arrange lower-risk meetings or playdates, Wen said, depending on the kids\' age., , , For children excited about returning to school, parents can emphasize the fun aspects children can anticipate, Wen added -- but they should also mentally prepare their children for possible pandemic regressions. , \"By and large, kids understand probably better than adults about how quickly things have been changing and evolving, so setting that expectation is important,\" Wen said. \"Talk to kids about the different possibilities of what might happen when. As in, \'If somebody tests positive, this might happen. If schools close, this is for how long and that\'s why it\'s important.\', \"Even on a daily basis, going through scenarios can actually help to provide a bit more certainty in an uncertain time.\" , ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/23/health/children-school-safety-concerns-pandemic-wellness/index.html',1,254),(186,'Full Covid-19 vaccine approval won\'t just boost confidence.

But full approval could give any legal challenge less potency., Full FDA approval would also give some skeptics of the Covid-19 vaccine more confidence in getting shots, according to research by the Kaiser Family Foundation. , \"This FDA approval cannot come a moment too soon,\" said emergency physician Dr. Megan Ranney, associate dean at the School of Public Health at Brown University.  , \"With this full approval in hand, we\'re going to have a chance to message again about the safety and effectiveness of this vaccine.

Such a feat had not occurred since the first week of July., But it\'s important to remember the vaccines don\'t fully kick in until two weeks after the final dose. \"Keep taking all precautions until you are fully vaccinated,\" the CDC says. , \"So we\'re still looking a tough couple of months ahead,\" Ranney said. , About 51.3% of Americans have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to CDC data. , Many Americans still need to get vaccinated to minimize the spread of the Delta variant and help keep children in classrooms, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said., \"We\'re encouraged by the increase in uptick of vaccines.

You are not a cow. Seriously, y\'all. Stop it.\", Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic medication, not an anti-viral. While it can be prescribed for humans suffering from parasitic worms or head lice, it\'s often given to much larger animals -- at much greater concentrations. , \"Such high doses can be highly toxic in humans,\" the FDA said.  , Still, the Mississippi Poison Control Center has received an increasing number of calls from people who took ivermectin. At least 70% of such calls related to \"ingestion of livestock or animal formulations of ivermectin purchased at livestock supply centers,\" the Mississippi State Department of Health said Friday., \"Some of the symptoms associated with ivermectin toxicity include rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, neurologic disorders, and potentially severe hepatitis requiring hospitalization,\" the health department said., The US surgeon general said tech companies need to do more to stop the spread of misinformation. , \"It\'s happening ... aided and abetted by social media platforms,\" Murthy said. , \"These are things that companies can and must change.

John Bel Edwards, as infections are increasing particularly among younger populations. , \"I can tell you that for the last couple of days, 28% of all the new cases that we\'re reporting are in children zero to 17,\" he said on Friday. , And Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said more people in the state were admitted to the hospital on Wednesday than any other single day. Nearly everyone in the ICU for Covid-19 is unvaccinated and six of the state\'s largest hospitals are at 100% capacity for ICU beds, she said., In Florida, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer on Friday asked residents to conserve water as liquid oxygen -- typically used to treat the community\'s water supply -- was being diverted to hospitals locally and statewide to treat critically ill Covid-19 patients. , According to data from the US Department of Health &amp; Human Services, more than 17,000 people are hospitalized with Covid-19 statewide. , \"This is another impact of the virus continuing to surge in our community,\" the mayor said in a Facebook post. \"And it\'s another result of what happens when residents do not get the vaccine and become critically ill, needing medical support and treatment.\", Here\'s the good news: Covid-19 vaccinations also continue to climb. , Saturday was the the third day in a row that more than 1 million Covid-19 vaccine doses were reported administered in a single day, according to data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The last time that happened was the first week of July., Over the last week, an average of 466,074 people have initiated vaccination each day, the data shows. About 170 million people -- or 51.3% of the total US population -- are now fully vaccinated. And nearly 201 million people -- 60.5% of the total population -- have received at least on dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. , Pfizer vaccine approval expected soon, Amid the rising case numbers, experts and officials are hopeful that an anticipated decision by the US Food and Drug Administration granting full approval for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will help persuade more Americans about its efficacy, getting those who are eligible and vaccine-hesitant on board with inoculations. , , A person familiar with the plan told CNN the decision is expected early next week, and a Biden administration official said approval of the two-dose vaccine, which has been distributed under emergency use authorization from the FDA, \"could be as early as Monday.\" , Each vaccine currently available in the United States has been authorized for emergency use. Pfizer/BioNTech\'s vaccine would be the first to receive full approval. , The New York Times reported that the FDA was pushing to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Monday, according to people familiar with the agency\'s planning., \"To all of those people who said they\'ve been waiting for full approval, I hope you\'ll go to vaccines.gov this weekend and make your appointment for next week, because again, it\'s coming,\" former US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper. \"What you asked for is coming.\", Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CNN\'s Jim Acosta Saturday that full authorization may help convince those who are \"on the fence about whether or not to get vaccinated.\" , \"It\'s also going to be helpful for some institutions that were hesitant about mandating vaccination, and the fact that it will be fully approved makes them less hesitant to do that,\" Frieden said. , \"We\'re seeing in more settings -- whether health care, or schools or workplaces -- that mandating vaccination, mandating masks is the way to get back to an economy, to get back to learning in person and to save a lot of lives.\" , More colleges are requiring vaccines, To ward off greater spreads of infection, additional college campuses and school systems are instituting vaccine requirements to attend classes or sporting events. , All students at state colleges, universities and community colleges throughout the state of Nevada will have to be vaccinated against Covid-19 this fall in order to sign up for in-person spring classes, according to Gov. Steve Sisolak\'s office. The mandate was approved by the state board of health Friday afternoon., , Nevada students must provide proof of vaccination by November 1 in order to be able to enroll in the following semester\'s classes. The mandate will be in effect for at least 120 days and provides for medical and religious exemptions. Additionally, students who do not attend classes in person are exempt., The University of Oregon announced that attendees ages 12 and older at university activities and sporting events must show proof of vaccination or a recent negative Covid-19 test beginning Monday. The state government earlier this week announced a vaccine requirement for all K-12 teachers and staff. , At least one university has already started enforcing its vaccine mandates. The University of Virginia in Charlottesville has disenrolled 238 students for its fall semester on Friday for not complying with the university\'s Covid-19 vaccine mandate, according to university spokesperson Brian Coy., About 96.6% of UVA\'s student body is vaccinated, Coy said, while about 1.3% were allowed to claim religious or medical exemptions. Students who were enrolled at the university on Wednesday still have a week to update their vaccination status, at which point they can then re-enroll., , , Significant racial disparities found in excess deaths last year, data shows, Meanwhile, researchers continue to examine the effects of the pandemic in 2020, before the widespread distribution of vaccines that helped keep those infected out of hospitals. , Not only did adults ages 65 and older see higher rates of excess deaths last year compared with other age groups, according to new research, but significant racial disparities were found as well., Among adults 65 and older, the highest rates of excess deaths were in Black and Hispanic people, according to a new study published by the CDC on Thursday. Among people younger than 65, Black, American Indian and Alaska Native people had the highest rates compared with other racial and ethnic groups., The findings \"have been driven, in part, by factors such as occupational risk, socioeconomic factors, housing conditions, reduced access to health care, and discrimination,\" the researchers from the US National Center for Health Statistics, Yale University and Harvard Medical School wrote in their new study., , The researchers analyzed data from the CDC\'s National Vital Statistics System on the weekly number of deaths from all causes and Covid-19 that occurred between December 29, 2019, and January 2, 2021. The researchers examined population estimates from the US Census Bureau for previous years, from 2015 to 2019, to model how many deaths would normally be expected through the year 2020. , \"The resulting weekly expected numbers of deaths were subtracted from the observed numbers of deaths to generate estimates of excess deaths,\" the researchers wrote. , In the data, they identified racial disparities across all age groups when it came to rates of excess deaths. Overall, they wrote that \"these findings could help guide more tailored public health messaging and mitigation efforts to reduce disparities in mortality associated with the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States, by identifying the racial/ethnic groups and age groups with the highest excess mortality rates.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/21/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html',1,258),(188,'As Covid-19 hospitalizations increase, a greater number of Americans are deciding to get vaccinated','With an alarming rise in More than 1 million doses of the vaccine were reported administered Thursday, new US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showed, marking the first time since early July for the single-day change in reported doses. The average pace of those initiating vaccination is more than 70% higher than one month ago., Oklahoma and Louisiana -- two states that have lagged the rest of the nation in vaccinations -- are now outpacing the national average, White House Covid-19 Response Team Chief of Staff Asma Mirza said in calls with local faith leaders Thursday., \"We\'re seeing a new willingness, a new openness to getting vaccinated,\" she said in a discussion with Louisiana faith leaders., And a senior federal official told CNN on Friday that full US Food and Drug Administration approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is \"imminent.\" A Biden administration official said approval of the two-dose vaccine \"could be as early as Monday.\" , Experts have said an FDA approval will likely help convince more Americans to get their shots. , \'Tsunami of patients\', For now, health care systems are reporting an increasingly dire situation, with an influx of patients flooding waiting rooms due largely to the spread of the more infectious Delta variant. , And because it takes weeks to gain immunity following full vaccination, even those beginning their inoculations need to remain cautious against infection. , Dr. Robert Jansen, chief medical officer at one of Atlanta\'s largest trauma centers, Grady Health System, said it was seeing a \"tsunami of patients coming into the emergency department.\" , The situation is also critical in Texas, where Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state will deploy additional medical personnel to hospitals across the state., Lauren Meyers, director of the University of Texas Covid-19 Modeling Consortium, warned that area hospitals are at a \"breaking point.\" , \"We are sort of in a very dire situation in Austin,\" Meyers said. , The rate of hospitalizations is still below pandemic highs seen in January, CDC data shows. But at the current pace -- an average of more than 11,000 new hospital admissions for Covid-19 over the past week -- the US might reach a record high within a month, the CDC said., , Mary Mayhew, CEO of the Florida Hospital Association (FHA), told CNN Friday the state\'s current surge is \"fundamentally different\" from earlier surges, with more than 17,000 Covid-19 patients hospitalized in about six weeks amid a \"severe staffing shortage.\", \"These are healthy, young 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds who, because of the aggressive nature of the Delta variant, are now being hospitalized,\" Mayhew said. , Hospitals across the state are doing everything possible to respond to the demand by postponing elective services and bringing in staff from other states, Mayhew said. They\'re even converting auditoriums and cafeterias \"to meet patient demand.\" , Preventative vaccinations are the most effective means to combat Covid-19 infections, and the US Food and Drug Administration will likely approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine around the end of August, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Mark McClellan said Thursday. Current vaccines have been granted emergency use authorization. , \"I think that approval, at least for the Pfizer vaccine, is going to come very soon -- probably by the end of the month or right around there,\" McClellan told CNN\'s Chris Cuomo., Booster shots for those inoculated are expected to be made widely available by September 20, and about 75% of the eligible population will have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine at current vaccination rates, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data., Around 51.1% of the total US population is fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. , , Vaccine requirements beginning to take shape, In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday continued to push the state\'s monoclonal antibody treatment centers, saying the state expected to have 21 treatment sites throughout the state by early next week -- an increase from the initial 15-20 centers announced by the governor. , , The treatment has been effective at reducing severe disease, but some scientists have been critical of the push for these treatments over other prevention methods, like vaccinations and masking. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, has said they are \"not the path out of this pandemic.\", With the efficacy of vaccines continuously proven in keeping recipients out of hospitals, more jurisdictions nationwide are taking steps requiring employees to be inoculated, barring medical or religious exemptions. , Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker issued an executive order Thursday that will require approximately 42,000 executive department employees to provide proof of vaccination by mid-October or face possible termination, according to a spokesperson. , In New Orleans, all city employees and public-facing personnel will need to submit proof of vaccination or receive routine Covid-19 testing starting August 30, according to Mayor LaToya Cantrell., The mayor\'s office said the additional step was taken \"to protect residents, City employees and public-facing contracted personnel from the Covid-19 outbreak, and more recently the Delta variant outbreak in Orleans Parish.\", In Oregon, all K-12 teachers, educators, staff and volunteers at schools -- both public and private -- will need to be fully vaccinated for Covid-19 by October 18 or six weeks after full FDA approval, Gov. Kate Brown announced at a press conference Thursday. , , The Houston Independent School District\'s Board of Education is taking a different approach by offering a $500 stipend for employees who are fully vaccinated by November 19. The board passed the measure on Thursday, though it still needs to be approved by the Texas Education Agency, the district said in a statement. , \"The best tool we have in this fight against the COVID-19 pandemic is vaccination,\" Superintendent Millard House II said in the release. \"As vaccinations increase in our communities and schools, the better protected and safe we all will be.\", Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN\'s Jake Tapper Thursday that vaccine requirements at schools is a sound strategy to create a safe environment.  , \"One of the most important ways is to surround the children with people who are vaccinated, if they\'re eligible to be vaccinated -- and that means teachers and personnel in the school,\" Fauci said., , \'This is not an adult disease anymore\', With schools back in session, local officials are faced with deciding whether to mandate masks in classrooms, plus the day-to-day challenges of quarantining students exposed to Covid-19. , Legal battles over mask mandates continued Thursday in Texas, as the state Supreme Court refused Gov. Abbott\'s request to quickly intervene over some local jurisdictions\' decision to require masks in schools., , Meantime, Alabama is now seeing the highest number of Covid-19 cases among children than at any other time during the pandemic, State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said Friday. , From August 1-18, 2020, the state saw 1,831 cases of Covid-19 in children between the ages of 5 and 17. But for that same period this year, the state saw 8,462 cases in that age range. , According to Harris, there were 50 pediatric patients hospitalized as of August 19, 9 of whom are on ventilators., Dr. Sara Cross, a member of the Covid-19 task force for Tennessee\'s governor and an infectious disease specialist at the University of Tennessee, said bans on mask mandates would have \"catastrophic consequences\" for those in classrooms. , \"When one child doesn\'t wear a mask, it doesn\'t only affect that child.

We are estimating that the number of cases in Tennessee will increase six-fold by the end of September if we don\'t take measures to mitigate the spread,\" Cross said. , , \"This is not an adult disease anymore,\" Cross said, saying the pediatric hospital in downtown Memphis \"currently has at least 9 children in the ICU from Covid-19.\", At least 15 states have temporarily or indefinitely required K-12 students to wear masks in schools, according to a CNN analysis, with some provided exceptions: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington. ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/20/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html',1,259),(189,'What should you do if you get a breakthrough infection? Our expert weighs in','Covid-19 vaccines are very effective against preventing infection, but no vaccine is 100% effective. Fully vaccinated people can and do become infected. It\'s not known exactly how many of these breakthrough infections are occurring, as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is not collecting national data this comprehensive. Based on reports from 25 states that do keep track of these data, the Many people have questions about what to do if they are vaccinated but test positive. Should they isolate, and for how long? What about family members — should they all get tested? What kinds of symptoms should make someone concerned that they might have a breakthrough infection? And how to address skeptics who question getting the vaccine if you can still get the coronavirus?, To glean answers to these questions, we turned to CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She\'s also author of a new book, \"Lifelines: A Doctor\'s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.\" , CNN: What should people do if they get a breakthrough infection? Should they isolate from their household members? Does it matter if they have symptoms?, Dr. Leana Wen: Someone who\'s vaccinated and tests positive for Covid-19 should definitely follow strict isolation protocols because we have to assume that the person is contagious and able to infect others. If that person is symptomatic, they should isolate for at least 10 days counting from the first day they started having symptoms, according to the CDC. They can end the isolation as long as they haven\'t had a fever for more than 24 hours and other symptoms are improving. If the person is not symptomatic but still had a positive test, they should stay isolated for 10 days following their positive test., Isolation means that they should not be going in public where they could infect others. They should also isolate from close household contacts. That means, if possible, staying in a part of the house away from others, in their own room. Essentially, once a person is infected with Covid-19, it doesn\'t matter for the purpose of isolation whether they were vaccinated — they could be contagious to others and need to follow standard isolation procedures., CNN: If one person in the household gets a breakthrough infection, should everyone get tested? , Wen: Yes. Close contacts should all be tested, with \"close contact\" defined as being within 6 feet for a total of at least 15 minutes over a 24-hour period during the potentially contagious period. The CDC differentiates guidance for those who are vaccinated versus those who are not. Those unvaccinated, if exposed to a close contact who has Covid-19, should quarantine for 10 days. They can shorten the quarantine to seven days if they have a negative test at least five days after exposure. During that quarantine period, they cannot be in public. , On the other hand, those fully vaccinated, when exposed to a close contact who has Covid-19, do not need to quarantine unless they develop symptoms. They should still get tested within three to five days after exposure and wear a mask in public for extra protection. , CNN: Does that mean a vaccinated person with a Covid-19 exposure can still go to work? , Wen: According to the CDC guidance, yes, as long as that person doesn\'t have symptoms, and they keep a mask on at all times and still get tested three to five days after exposure., This CDC guidance is missing needed nuance. Consider this: Would you be comfortable sitting shoulder to shoulder with a work colleague around a conference table if you knew that this person\'s spouse was just diagnosed with Covid-19? Even if the CDC guidance says that this can be done, I think we need to use some common sense, too. If your spouse or child has Covid-19 and you\'re still waiting for your coronavirus test, I\'d urge you to tell your supervisor and see if you could work from home at least until you get a negative test result., I\'d also distinguish between what was the level of your exposure to the person who tested positive. If you were at an outdoor party and standing next to someone who ended up testing positive, you should still get tested yourself, but your risk of having coronavirus is pretty low, and it might be reasonable to continue going to work — masked, of course. But if it\'s your child or partner with whom you spend many hours together, in close, indoor quarters, you are at much higher risk of contracting Covid-19 from them and so should try not to expose others if possible., CNN: What are the symptoms of breakthrough Covid-19 infections?, Wen: The key benefit of vaccination is that it reduces the likelihood of severe illness. Those vaccinated who still contract coronavirus are much more likely to have mild symptoms compared to if they were not vaccinated. An individual who might have been very ill with high fever, severe cough and so much trouble breathing that they need oxygen or a ventilator, could now instead have body aches, fatigue and the sniffles. That\'s the power of vaccination — it reduces the severity of illness. , Since the symptoms in the vaccinated are much milder than the unvaccinated, be on the lookout for even one of the symptoms of Covid-19. These include fever, chills, cough, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, sore throat, runny nose, nausea, diarrhea and loss of taste or smell. Of course, this is a broad list, and it could indicate other viral illnesses, too. , Given how much coronavirus is surging in most parts of the country, keep your radar on high alert. If something doesn\'t feel quite right to you, get tested., CNN: If you find out you\'re positive, should you tell your colleagues? What if you were at a party — do you tell the host?, Wen: You should follow procedures at your workplace. Talk to your manager, who may direct you to your company\'s human resources department or someone else who can help with contact tracing. Generally, this would include identifying the individuals with whom you had close contact in the time period that you could have been contagious. This typically includes up to 48 hours before the beginning of your symptoms. , You should definitely think through what social activities you were engaged in during that potentially infectious period. If you were at a party, you should tell the host, as well as guests with whom you can remember spending prolonged periods of time with. , This is work that your local health department\'s contact tracers should be conducting, but in many places, they are overwhelmed. Remember, too, that the contact tracers depend on you to recall where you were, and you would know best as to who you were with when. It\'s important to let those you could have exposed know as soon as possible; we would want the same courtesy ourselves., CNN: Do you need to test again before you\'re cleared to go back to work?, Wen: No. Assuming you haven\'t had a fever for more than 24 hours and your other symptoms are improving, 10 days after the beginning of your symptoms is the isolation period as recommended by the CDC. After that, you can end isolation and go back to work and interact with others. , CNN: Would a booster shot help to reduce breakthrough infections?, Wen: Probably. Federal health officials have already said that people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, who received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, can receive a third dose now. The White House just announced that beginning the week of September 20, pending a final go-ahead from the FDA and CDC, they will begin allowing people who are at least eight months from their initial vaccinations to get a booster dose. That\'s because vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic illness appears to decrease over time (though the vaccines still protect very well against severe disease), so one might expect that a booster shot would prevent future breakthrough infections. I\'d advise that you speak with your doctor. The decision for a booster dose is probably not a one-size-fits-all recommendation, but an individualized decision depending on your medical circumstances., CNN: Some people might be asking what\'s the point of getting vaccinated if breakthrough infections can still happen?, Wen: We get vaccinated for two reasons. Remember that vaccination reduces the likelihood of severe illness — according to estimates from CDC data, by about 25 times. Second, vaccination also reduces getting Covid-19 by about eight times. A vaccinated person is much less likely to get sick from Covid-19 and spread it, compared to someone who is not vaccinated., Why do breakthrough infections still happen? We can think of vaccination as a very good raincoat. The raincoat will keep you dry in a drizzle. It might even work in a thunderstorm. But if you are in thunderstorms day after day, and sometimes going through hurricanes, at some point, you may get wet. The problem isn\'t that the raincoat isn\'t working — it\'s that there is too much bad weather all around you., That\'s what is happening now with Covid-19 around the country. The level of virus is so high that the vaccine alone may not be enough to protect you. That\'s why a mask can help, as can reducing the number of high-risk environments you\'re in. Ultimately, we need to reduce the level of virus around us — and the best way to do that is through all of us getting vaccinated.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/21/health/vaccinated-breakthrough-infections-covid-wellness/index.html',1,260),(190,'Rates of Covid-19 hospitalizations for children and adults under 50 reach their highest levels yet, CDC data shows','The pace of Every age group under 50 has surpassed its previous record of hospitalizations, which were recorded in the first half of January. The biggest increase was in adults ages 30 to 39 and children under 18, both of which were more than 30% higher than their previous peak, according to the CDC data. , \"During this surge of the Delta variant ... we are seeing a significantly greater impact on our children and our teens,\" Dr. Jim Fortenberry, chief medical officer at Children\'s Healthcare of Atlanta, said at a news conference Thursday, where several hospital officials in the Atlanta area warned of the impact the current surge is having on their hospitals. , Children\'s Healthcare of Atlanta\'s three hospitals are now seeing more children who have Covid-19 than at any other time during the pandemic, Fortenberry said, with 31 children hospitalized in total. , \"Many of our kids can\'t get the vaccine because of their ages, so we all play a role in preventing the spread to them,\" Fortenberry said. \"The best way to protect all of our kids is to get vaccinated, that includes any child 12 or greater, and every one of us as adults.\" , \"It is the way out of the pandemic right now,\" he said. , The rate of hospitalizations for all ages is still below the January high, CDC data shows. But at the current pace -- an average of more than 11,000 new hospital admissions for Covid-19 over the past week -- the US might reach a record high within a month, the CDC said. , Those most at risk of experiencing severe illness and hospitalization are the unvaccinated, according to experts. Yet only 51.1% of the population is fully vaccinated against the virus, according to the CDC., The alarming surge in cases, driven by the more transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus, has been met with pleas from health experts and officials for more people to get vaccinated. , It has also spurred an often-acrimonious debate about mask mandates, especially in schools, as well as a growing realization that booster vaccine shots may be required to address waning efficacy., , Vaccinating children is a priority, In the current surge, health experts are particularly concerned about children going back to school -- especially those who are too young to be vaccinated., Currently, children under 12 are not eligible for the vaccines, although clinical trials are ongoing., Making vaccinations available to children is a priority for the Biden administration, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said, and the US Food and Drug Administration will evaluate the data from clinical trials quickly once it\'s provided by the companies that make the vaccines. , \"The Covid-19 vaccine reviews are the top priority for the FDA,\" Murthy told CNN on Thursday. \"And they will move quickly to make sure that a thorough review is done, but that it\'s done on the fastest feasible time schedule, because we all want to protect our kids.\" , Murthy indicated it was possible vaccines could be available to children under the age of 12 before the end of the year. \"That\'s certainly what I\'m hoping for,\" he said. , Earlier this week, Reps. Ro Khanna and Katie Porter requested a meeting with the FDA on the status of emergency use authorizations for vaccinating children aged 2 to 11., \"Parents need to know what the FDA\'s plan is and what the timeline is for authorizing vaccinations for children,\" Porter, a California Democrat, told CNN on Thursday. \"The American public should be kept apprised of what the process is and what are the roadblocks are that they\'re facing. We shouldn\'t be wondering if they\'re just sitting on their hands.\", In the past two weeks, vaccinations among adolescents have been on the rise, leading some experts to speculate that parents who were once hesitant to get their children vaccinated are reconsidering their decisions after seeing more young people falling ill., Debate over masks in schools, The impact of the surge in cases has been felt in school districts that have resumed in-person classes., In Mississippi, there have been 20,334 students who have had to quarantine due to potential Covid-19 exposures between August 9-13, according to data from the state\'s department of health., The students in quarantine represent 4.6% of the total number of students in Mississippi schools, according to state enrollment figures., And throughout Florida\'s 15 largest school districts, at least 4,641 students and 1,547 employees have tested positive for coronavirus, according to a CNN analysis. Another 19,072 students and staff members have been quarantined or isolated due to Covid-19., Florida officials have been at odds over precautions: The Miami Dade County Public School Board voted Wednesday to implement a mask mandate without parental opt-outs, except with an excuse from a health care provider, despite Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, earlier banning schools from mandating masks. , The school board for Hillsborough County Public Schools -- where more than 12,000 students are in isolation or quarantine, according to its Covid-19 dashboard -- also voted 5-2 Wednesday to approve a mask mandate, allowing for parents to opt out only for medical reasons. , On Thursday, DeSantis responded by reiterating he feels \"that the parents understand what is best for their kids.\" , Asked to respond to the debate unfolding in Florida, Surgeon General Murthy said Thursday he worries about areas where schools are blocked from putting Covid-19 protection measures in place. , The science \"clearly\" shows that masks work to reduce infection spread, Murthy said. Additionally, strategies like contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, improved ventilation and regular testing are layers of protection that can reduce the risk for children. , \"We\'ve got to take a community approach to this, got to recognize that we\'ve got to get through this together and take care of each other,\" Murthy said. \"And the scientific public health approaches have shown us that the best way to do that is to follow these layers of precaution that we\'ve been talking about for the last many months.\" , Meantime, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is standing by an executive order he signed last week mandating masks in schools, telling CNN Thursday, \"I know what is right.\" , Beshear, a Democrat, told CNN\'s Kate Bolduan he would rather look back at this time knowing he did the right thing for the health of residents in his state, and not just what would be popular. , \"Sending unmasked, unvaccinated kids into a poorly ventilated classroom is like holding the world\'s largest chickenpox party, except instead of chickenpox it is the third leading cause of death last year.\" , Boosters to be available from late September, US health officials released a joint statement Wednesday about providing booster vaccine doses in the fall, if authorized by the FDA and approved by the CDC., But experts stressed that planning for boosters does not mean that vaccinated people are not protected, and Murthy stressed that people who are fully vaccinated should still be confident about that protection., The protection provided against what Murthy described as \"the worst of Covid,\" like hospitalizations, severe disease and death, \"remains strong, and that is why people who are fully vaccinated should still feel good.\", Data is currently showing some waning protection against mild and moderate disease, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said, and the boosters are meant to preempt the possible waning of protection against severe disease that other countries have seen., The recent data deals primarily with the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, and Johnson &amp; Johnson said Wednesday it would release more information soon on the question of boosting its one-shot vaccine., National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins likened the waning protection to realizing it is time to start looking for a gas station when driving a car., \"It\'s like the gas gauge is getting kind of low,\" Collins said. \"That\'s kind of where it is with the people that got those first doses back in January. They\'re not in a crisis right now, but it\'s time to start making a plan.\" , Collins said he was among the experts skeptical about the need to prepare for booster shots, but he was convinced by the latest data from the CDC and overseas. , \"Putting all that together, those of us looking at this and trying not to wait until the last-minute sort of said let\'s work on this over the course of the next month,\" he told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper., Dr. Anthony Fauci said Wednesday it is not likely people will need a Covid-19 vaccine booster every eight months., \"I don\'t think that\'s going to be the case,\" Fauci told NBC\'s Lester Holt, citing data from studies with booster shots that indicate \"the level of antibody that has been elevated by that third shot is extraordinary.\" ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/19/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html',1,261),(191,'Study finds \'very concerning\' 74% increase in deaths associated with extreme heat brought on by the climate crisis ','A pair of new studies out Thursday find a \"very concerning\" rise in the number of climate-related deaths and paint a picture of world where people struggle with regular temperature extremes.One of the studies finds the number of deaths caused by high temperatures increased by 74% globally between 1980 and 2016. Deaths related to extreme cold increased 31% since 1990, a new report, the first of its kind, finds., Human-caused climate change -- generated by carbon, methane and other greenhouse gas emissions  from industry, transportation, and agriculture -- has led to a \"new normal\" with more days of extreme temperatures than in recorded history. The studies published Thursday provide more evidence that both hot and cold extremes can be deadly. , , \"The papers we publish today provide a strong scientific argument that the health dimensions of heat can no longer be overlooked,\" the Lancet, which published the twin studies, said in an editorial., Heat-related deaths and illnesses are preventable, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and yet more than 600 people in the US alone are killed by extreme heat every year. This year has already seen hundreds of deaths related to an historic heat wave in the US West. By the end of the century, more than half of the global population is projected to be exposed to weeks of dangerous heat every year., For this new study, the University of Washington researchers examined 64.9 million death records from nine different countries and determined that at least 1.69 million of those deaths could be attributed to extreme temperatures in 2019 alone. About 356,000 were linked to extreme heat and 1.3 million were related to extreme cold temperatures. , These are conservative estimates, they reported in the Lancet, and those numbers will continue to grow as the world experienced more extreme temperatures., , , These extreme temperatures can linked to at least 17 causes of death, most related to heart trouble and breathing issues, but these excess temperature related deaths also include suicide, drowning and homicides. , Earlier studies have shown that exposure to extreme heat can also cause mental health issues, problems for pregnant women and poor birth outcomes. The elderly, people with chronic health conditions and children are at the highest risk for heat-related illnesses., \"Our analysis finds that the harmful effects of extreme heat can far exceed those caused by cold in places where it is already hot, such as Southern Asia, the Middle East and many parts of Africa,\" said study co-author Dr. Katrin Burkhart, with the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. \"This is very concerning, particularly given that the risk of exposure to high temperatures appears to have been increasing steadily for decades.\", Environmental epidemiologist Tarik Benmarhnia of the University of California, San Diego, said the CDC death numbers only reflect when a death certificate is explicit about heat being a cause of death. He said the new study accounts for the indirect deaths. \"What a lot of people don\'t get, and what explains why the burden is huge is because heat becomes the, as you say in English, \'the straw that broke the camel\'s back,\'\" Benmarhnia, who was not involved in the research, told CNN.,  \"What is most problematic about heat is that this is a sneaky climate issue, because it kills  many people, but it is not impressive like a hurricane or something. It\'s just happening all the time, so it is sneaky.\", Pairing this study with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report from last week, which showed the earth is warming faster than previously thought, shows that \"we face a pretty scary future\" said Natural Resources Defense Council climate and health scientist Vijay Limaye. And keep in mind, he said, the figures in the study are a conservative estimate., \"Of course climate change is going to worsen all sorts of other health risks, but even thinking beyond heart and lung disease, this study suggests then we can expect to see pretty big jumps in these other external causes,\" Limaye, who was not involved in the research, told CNN. \"We need to learn from studies like this as we shape our understanding and response to the climate crisis.\", , , In a separate study, the researchers argue that as people struggle to stay cool, turning to air conditioning is expensive and adds to greenhouse gas emissions. People need more sustainable and affordable cooling options., Evidence-based cooling strategies,  such as battery-driven fans and accessible water to wet clothing to keep people cool, are more widely needed to prevent heat-related health problems, they argued. Urban areas need more green space, architects could use wall coatings to reflect heat from buildings, and governments need to take more proactive approaches to invest in research and create strategies that would minimize the impact of high temperatures on health., Kristie Ebi of the University of Washington said the world needs two major strategic approaches to combat the problems that come with extreme heat. , , First, the world needs to reduce its carbon emissions so that the planet does not continue to warm. Earlier research showed that if the world continues producing the same amount of carbon emissions, a child born in 2019 could be living in a world with an average temperature that\'s 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) warmer by their 71st birthday., On any given day, a 7.2-degree difference might not sound like much, but as an average increase in temperature, it would be devastating for human health and in addition to disease, a warmer world means more famine and early death from natural disasters such as fire and heat waves. , , The other strategy is to find and implement the appropriate response measures, particularly in parts of the world that don\'t have a lot of financial resources. These might include early warning systems and better systems to monitor and predict when these heat waves will happen, as well as science-based cooling strategies. , \"Failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to develop and deploy evidence-based heat action plans will mean a very different future awaits many people and communities around the world,\" Ebi said in a statement., Ebi added that regular summer activities like construction work outdoors and exercising will have to change dramatically. People are already experiencing these extreme temperatures., , \"Extremely hot days or heat waves that were experienced approximately every 20 years are now being seen more frequently and could even occur every year by the end of this century if current greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated,\" Ebi said. , \"These rising temperatures combined with a larger and older population, mean that even more people will be at risk for heat-related health effects.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/19/health/heat-deaths-concerning-study/index.html',1,262),(192,'Full FDA approval of Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is \'imminent\', senior federal official says','Full US Food and Drug Administration approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is \"imminent,\" a senior federal official told CNN on Friday --  but said no date has been mentioned.

Worried about sending her young son to in-person school last year, she settled on one of the few things she could control. She bought a portable air cleaner for her son\'s classroom., She\'s joining air quality experts who are urging schools to do more this fall to make sure kids -- as well as teachers and staff -- are breathing air as free as possible from coronavirus particles., \"Parents are feeling like they are not in control of the situation, and this is something they potentially could do to add peace of mind,\" Nuzzo, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told CNN., \"They are not cheap, but they are not as expensive as some of the alternatives, such as private schools or hiring nannies,\" Nuzzo said., \"In my view it was worthwhile investment,\" she added. \"It adds a layer of protection, for sure.\", Filtered or fresh air is not a substitute for masks and certainly no substitute for vaccination, but it\'s another way to help protect people stuck indoors for hours from breathing in the virus, said Joseph Allen, who directs the Healthy Buildings Program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, \"This is easier than people think,\" Allen told CNN., \"It is actually quite simple to improve the air quality inside classrooms,\" added Allen, who has been advocating for better air ventilation in schools and other buildings as a way to control coronavirus spread since the pandemic started., \"There is still plenty of time. And, quite honestly, if a school system or district hasn\'t done this already, that is a signal that you have failed leadership. The strategies to improve air quality in schools have been out there for over a year. The resources are available. There is money available and it is not complicated.\" He has an online tool to help calculate what size portable air cleaner to use., But Claire Barnett, the executive director of the Healthy Schools Network, said the money isn\'t clearly available, schools may not understand how to get it, and they may struggle to understand what\'s worth doing and what\'s not., \"It\'s complicated. First of all, it\'s not easy to fix ventilation systems,\" Barnett told CNN., \"If you have to do all new installations, it is expensive,\" she added., The $550 billion infrastructure bill provides some money, but none is clearly marked for use to improve indoor air quality, she said -- although the Department of Education issued guidance Thursday reminding schools of the funds available., HVAC systems or air filters must fit the rooms they are used for, providing the correct rate of what\'s called air exchange -- cleaning or replacing old air with fresh air at a rate fast enough to get rid of any virus people might be breathing out before someone else can breathe it in., \"I think it\'s a no-brainer,\" she said. \"But at least half the schools haven\'t done anything.\", Allen agrees that not enough schools have acted., \"Over the past year, I\'ve heard every excuse not to act you could imagine. \'My building\'s too old. It\'s too expensive. it takes so long. I don\'t have windows,\'\" he said. \"And in reality, the strategies we are talking about are not hard. They are not expensive and they can be done quicky.\", Portable air cleaners, or properly filtered HVAC systems, can remove the virus from the air -- and other pollutants, as well, Allen said., \"These devices capture particles from the air. They are terrific for wildfire smoke. They\'re terrific for general outdoor air pollution,\" he added. \"These are plug and play.\", There are low-tech options too. \"If you do have windows, you can open up the windows, open up the doors, create some cross ventilation. That\'s a good strategy.\", Managers of schools and other buildings should have been improving ventilation long ago, Allen said., \"These are things we should have been doing for a long time to protect against other respiratory viruses like influenza,\" he said. Studies also show that better air quality improves students\' test performance and cognitive function, he said., \"We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to correct this. There is the will and there are stimulus dollars,\" he said. , \"If you do this right, if schools do this right, and follow this simple guidance we\'ve been giving it can provide now, they will provide benefits not only during COVID but for years if not decades after this.\" , His fear: that school districts will waste the chance., Nuzzo and Barnett share that fear., \"I know there are a whole bunch of gimmicky things out there,\" Nuzzo said., \"We are particularly concerned about foggers and the electrostatic sprayers, spraying disinfectants,\" said Barnett., Cleaning products can end up polluting indoor air, she said.

FDA officials have said agency staffers are working as fast as they can to finalize approval., Federal health officials are clear that Covid-19 vaccines are the FDA\'s top priority, but the agency must gather more information for some pending decisions from vaccine manufacturers. It\'s also got to get the paperwork just right, officials say., The FDA relies on manufacturers to submit data when applying for an amended authorization or full licensure -- and only then can the agency take action. , US health officials announced plans for offering Covid-19 booster doses to some starting the week of September 20. But those plans are subject to authorization from the FDA and signoff from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. , So far, only Pfizer has submitted initial booster data to the FDA; the company said Phase 3 results evaluating the third dose are expected shortly., At the same time it\'s considering boosters, the FDA is also working with  pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson towards full approval-- a process known as Biologics License Application or BLA., , Timelines for Covid-19 vaccine approval , Pfizer/BioNTech\'s submission has been accepted for priority review by the FDA. Once it receives approval, the companies said,  they also plan to seek approval of a booster dose for people 16 and older., As for the other two companies with authorized vaccines in the United States, Moderna has begun submitting data for approval of its two-dose vaccine, and Johnson &amp; Johnson has not yet submitted data for full approval, but expects to do so. , The FDA is moving quickly, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Mark McClellan said., \"I think that approval, at least for the Pfizer vaccine, is going to come very soon -- probably by the end of the month or right around there,\" McClellan, director of the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy at Duke University, told CNN\'s Chris Cuomo this week., \"The agency\'s trying not to cut corners on it, but it\'s still going much faster than a usual approval process takes -- instead of six months, just a couple of months,\" McClellan said. He added that approvals for other Covid-19 vaccines will likely follow., \"There will be approvals coming along in the months ahead, in all likelihood, for the Moderna vaccine, the J&amp;J vaccine, after that,\" he said. \"Hopefully that will add to the confidence that people have about the vaccines.\", Timelines for vaccines for younger children, Meanwhile, parents and pediatricians around the country are growing impatient for a vaccine for children younger than 12. Each of the vaccine makers has been testing their vaccines in younger age groups, but the results aren\'t in yet, and the FDA recently requested additional data from the trials, shifting some timelines., Pfizer has said it expects to have vaccine trial data on children ages 5 to 11 by the end of September, and the company could apply to have its vaccine authorized for those younger ages shortly after. The company also has said data for even younger children, ages 2 to 5, could be available shortly after., Moderna, whose vaccine is currently available for people 18 and older, has applied with the FDA for authorization for adolescents ages 12 to 17 and is waiting for a response from the agency. The company expects to have vaccine trial data on younger children later this year or toward the beginning of 2022., Johnson &amp; Johnson has said that it has designed four late-stage studies on its vaccine for young children, modeled after its small trials with 16- and 17-year-olds. The company is in \"active discussions with regulatory authorities regarding our development plan and trial designs,\" and anticipates those late-stage trials will start in the fall., US health officials have said that the nation\'s effort to provide booster shots in the fall will not impact the timeline for authorizing first doses for younger children. Following the announcement of the US booster plan, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said the timeline for authorizing vaccines for younger ages has not changed., \"The timing of what we are saying with boosters today has absolutely nothing to do with the timing of when kids\' vaccinations will be available,\" Walensky told CNN\'s Kate Bolduan on Wednesday. , \"I am a parent myself. I understand the importance of getting our younger kids vaccinated,\" Walensky said. \"But one is not slowing down the other by any stretch.\", , US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said on Thursday that the FDA will move quickly to thoroughly review each company\'s trial data on vaccines for young children., \"The Covid-19 vaccine reviews are the top priority for the FDA,\" Murthy told CNN\'s Brianna Keilar. \"As soon as they get the data from the companies and the trials are underway, they will review it. It is possible that we may have vaccines for under 12s before the end of the calendar year. That\'s certainly what I\'m hoping for.

One month on, here\'s how it\'s going','It\'s been a month since In an open letter published in the Lancet medical journal, they argued that a rising number of Covid-19 cases, the new Delta variant and the fact that a large part of the UK population was not yet fully vaccinated made the move too risky. , But the government was determined to push ahead., It removed all limits on mixing and allowed venues like nightclubs and sports stadiums to open at full capacity starting on July 19. Face masks are no longer required apart from in a few specific locations, such as airports and hospitals. And as of Monday, fully vaccinated people are no longer required to quarantine after coming into contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus. , A month on, it\'s becoming clear that while vaccination works, the reopening has come at a cost. , \"The UK is averaging around 90 deaths a day from Covid. Our reopening has been far from an unqualified success,\" said Kit Yates, co-director of the Centre for Mathematical Biology at the University of Bath. , While the death toll is much lower than it was at the peak of the pandemic, when as many as 1,300 people were dying every day, experts like Yates say it\'s still unnecessarily high. , And with roughly 800 Covid-19 patients ending up in hospital each day, the UK\'s public health system is once again under pressure and unable to provide non-emergency care at the level that is needed, Yates said. , \"There isn\'t capacity to carry out all the routine treatment that\'s necessary. As a result people are missing out on lifesaving treatment,\" he said., The number of people waiting for routine hospital treatment has risen to 5.5 million in July from 4.4 million in February 2020, according to NHS Providers. , \"If there was one lesson I wish other countries would take from watching the UK\'s attempt to reopen is that vaccines are not the whole solution to the problem,\" Yates told CNN., \"Yes, they make a huge difference, but if you want to keep on top of this disease then you need to back vaccines up with other tried and tested public health measures: Mask mandates in indoor public spaces, ventilation in schools and work places, a functioning, locally-driven test, trace and isolate system in combination with support for isolation,\" he added., Cases dropped, then rose again, Epidemiologists expected the reopening would lead to an increase in the number of people becoming infected with the coronavirus -- but this didn\'t happen, at least not immediately., , While the number of new cases increased just before the restrictions were lifted, it went down in the first few weeks after the reopening. This unexpected drop was likely down to the fact that contacts between people didn\'t increase as rapidly as some predicted, and because the Euro 2020 football tournament, which led to a spike in cases, ended on July 11., \"Thankfully, although technically we\'ve lifted restrictions, the UK looks a very different place than it did before the pandemic. My workplace is still practically deserted. It\'s quite clear that people are not behaving as they were before the pandemic,\" said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh. , \"There\'s an awful lot of scope for people to change their behavior more to allow more transmission of the virus in the future. Whether they will, we don\'t know -- predicting people\'s behavior in the face of an unprecedented pandemic is a fool\'s game, really,\" he said. , The spike in cases before the reopening meant a large number of people were in quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tested positive. More than 2 million people were \"pinged\" by the track and trace app in July alone, according to the NHS. , On top of that, the school summer vacation got underway in England on July 16. , Christina Pagel, director of the Clinical Operational Research Unit at University College London, said it has now become clear that schools played an important part in the overall picture, adding that cases in children have been halving every week since the beginning of the holidays. , But while the overall infection levels dropped in the first few weeks after the reopening, they have started creeping up again., \"In the last two weeks, cases in adults have started going up again, and more than you would know just from looking at the numbers, because they\'re kind of masked by the big drops in cases in children,\" Pagel said., She said the increase in cases is worrying, because July and August are precisely the months when it should be easier to keep infection levels down. , \"We\'re still in a situation where we have a lot of cases and a lot of poor health from Covid, so I think there is kind of a bit of trepidation about what happens when we go back to school in September,\" she said., While hospitalizations in the UK are on the rise, the proportion of people who end up in hospital now is much lower than it used to be, thanks to vaccination. , \"In January, before the vaccination program really got into full swing we were maybe seeing upwards of 10% of cases going on to be hospitalized. Now that figure is down to between 2% and 3%, so vaccines are making a huge difference,\" Yates said., , The data also shows that while overall vaccination rates matter, the key is in the detail. , The UK has fully vaccinated 60% of its total population, according to Our World in Data, while in the US, that figure stands at 51%, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the overall rate is similar, the US has more unvaccinated elderly people who are more vulnerable to the disease. , \"In the over-50s, in our vulnerable populations, we have 90% to 95% fully vaccinated. And that\'s making a really big difference. So we do have a lot of hospitalizations, but it\'s nowhere near as high as it could be,\" Pagel said, referring to the UK population., \"And if you look at places like Florida, which is seeing unsustainable hospitalizations, this is because they have a higher number of people who are still vulnerable, so even though they have high vaccination rates overall, it\'s not helping them as much because of how its distributed in their population,\" she added. , According to the Florida Department of Health, 79% of people aged between 60 and 64 and 86% of people above the age of 65 have been vaccinated.  , Kids on the front line, In England, next month\'s return to school is a major risk, because most kids won\'t be vaccinated against the disease., The UK medicines watchdog, the MHRA, has approved the Pfizer and Moderna shots for children and teenagers aged 12 and above, but only clinically vulnerable teenagers have been able to get the shots so far. , The government said Sunday that 16- and 17-year-olds will be offered the vaccine by next week, but there has been no announcement on inoculation for younger children. , \"We will see lots of students meeting up indoors in schools at which few or no mitigations have been put in place ... we should expect to see further rises in transmission when this happens, which will inevitably lead to more cases, more hospitalizations and tragically more deaths,\" Yates said. , Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer in machine learning at Queen Mary University of London, has long been critical of the government\'s approach to the reopening, arguing that the plan put children at unnecessary risk. , \"They may not individually get hospitalized or die at the same rate, but if enough of them get infected, then a large number will still get hospitalized and sadly, some will die. And they do get long Covid,\" she said, pointing to data released by the Office for National Statistics earlier this month, which showed that 34,000 kids aged 17 and under are suffering from long Covid, with 22,000 of them saying their illness is having an impact on their day-to-day activities. , \"These are not mild cases ... 7,000 have had persistent symptoms for more than one year. That\'s not mild,\" she said. , Pagel said that while schools don\'t appear to be major drivers of new infections when overall community transmission levels remain low, they become a problem when Covid levels are higher -- as they are right now in the UK., \"Every other high income country is doing at least one of three things ... they are either vaccinating adolescents, or they\'re keeping in mitigation (measures) in schools such as masks and social distancing, isolation and (investing in) ventilation, or they\'re keeping community transmission low ... most of them are doing two of those things. We\'re not doing any of them,\" she said.

That\'s a no-brainer. I choose my kids.\", Parents describe a bait-and-switch situation. They were asked to choose between virtual and in-person learning in the spring, they say, when the school system was taking precautions -- including requiring masks, social distancing, Plexiglas dividers and limits on cafeteria capacity -- only to find school leaders significantly relaxed the protocols after parents opted for a return to the classroom. The lack of transparency in the decision-making is another frustration, parents say. , Parents in favor of masks plan a demonstration before the Cobb County Board of Education\'s monthly meeting Thursday. The meeting\'s agenda makes no mention of Covid-19 protocols. , Last week, a protest -- held the day after East Side Elementary\'s entire fifth-grade class was sent home because of a spike in Covid-19 cases -- turned testy when pro-mask parents showed up to find counterprotesters defending the decision to \"unmask\" children., \"I feel like they\'re catering to a minority because they\'re louder and they\'re meaner and they\'re not rational,\" said Amber OBot, who is considering making her 5-year-old wait till next year to start kindergarten unless the county changes its policy. , The row unfolding in one of Georgia\'s largest and wealthiest counties, which oversees the education of more than 112,000 students, is among many that parents are witnessing across the nation. , As they send kids back to school amid an atmosphere in which science and politics collide, the Delta variant is driving a surge in cases and children younger than 12 are not yet eligible to receive vaccines. It\'s forcing many school districts to rethink their plans. , As of last week, the district reported 551 active cases in its schools. East Cobb Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine warned parents Tuesday it had reached a tipping point, with a \"dramatic rise in pediatric infections.\" The practice is canceling well visits in upcoming weeks to focus on sick children, its letter to parents says. , Cobb County has reported more than 88,000 cases and 1,144 deaths since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Cobb\'s region, almost every hospital bed and intensive care unit is filled. , Board member: \'Nothing has been debunked\', Six of the school board\'s seven members did not respond to CNN\'s request for comment, nor did Superintendent Chris Ragsdale or his assistant. The only response came from the email account of Vice Chairman David Banks. The email began, \"Are masks useless?\" and the writer introduced himself as \"Emery L. of Smyrna Georgia,\" a retired naval officer and former hospital administrator., Asked whether Banks or Emery L. wrote the email, which came from Banks\' official school board account, and for more information on Emery L.\'s credentials (the email redacts the name of a \"research project\" Emery L. purports to have \"operated\" for 15 years), there was no response. The board members and superintendent declined to say if emails sent from Banks\' account to the press and parents constitute official communications., \"Those pushing the use of masks DO NOT KNOW what they are talking about,\" the email says, flatly -- and falsely -- claiming masks offer zero protection against viruses. , The email ends with a paragraph of vague sourcing, including a \"Summary from official publications of Mask Facts by Emery Leonard-July 23,2020,\" along with a \"study\" in an online magazine that is not a study but a series of tweets posted by a Texas entrepreneur last year. , One mother took Banks to task in an email, saying he was relying on debunked information, and it was \"deeply disturbing, terrifying and embarrassing\" he was making decisions concerning her children. In bullet points, she explained how each of his sources was so obscure that the citations did not allow parents to vet his sources, according to the correspondence from the mother, who shared the emails with CNN on the condition of anonymity. , \"Nothing has been debunked. This is in your head! Be safe,\" Banks replied with no elaboration. , Other parents also shared emails they received from Banks citing Emery L. as a source. In them, Banks, a retired information technology consultant, includes long-debunked videos from doctors with questionable credentials and makes a series of egregiously false claims., To skim the highlights: Masks don\'t work for any virus; there\'s \"NO valid test\" for Covid-19; \"Covid shots do not protect very well from Covid 19\"; Dr. Anthony Fauci paid a Chinese government lab to research Covid-19 and lied to the US Senate about it; Covid-19 vaccines killed 12,366 people in their first seven months of use; and the vaccines contain toxic chemicals that can \"penetrate the brain with injury, and infect the entire human body.\", Parents say they\'re frustrated but not surprised. Banks has come under fire before for controversial remarks, including referring to Covid-19 as the \"China virus\" and telling a local newspaper he opposed a board resolution on systemic racism, in part, because there are \"black-on-black\" problems in south Cobb, and it\'s \"a cultural thing. When 70 percent don\'t have fathers in the house, that\'s a problem.\", \'This is not quarantining\', Dr. Timothy Lin is one of 239 local doctors who signed a letter to Ragsdale and the school board expressing dismay that the district has \"chosen to disregard best practices for mitigation.\", \"Our students, staff and community deserve to be protected while they learn, yet your decisions have placed the majority of them at risk,\" the letter says, pointing out that experts suggest closing schools when a community sees 100 cases per 100,000 people. , Cobb County recorded 493 cases per 100,000 as of Friday, the letter says. The 14-day average as of Wednesday was 694 per 100,000, according to the county health department., A pulmonary critical care specialist, Lin knows reports of rising case numbers are no hoax, so falsehoods like those spread by Banks are frustrating, he said. , Mountain View Elementary, where his 8- and 9-year-old go to school, hasn\'t had many reported cases, he said, but his kids are wearing their masks nonetheless. Still, some matters are out of his hands, such as Cobb County schools\' quarantine policy, which allows children who\'ve had close Covid-19 contacts to continue attending school if they\'re asymptomatic and wear a mask. , \"If you don\'t think masks work, why do you think masks are going to work if you\'re exposed?\" he asked, referring to Banks\' email to parents. \"If you look up the definition of quarantine -- this is not quarantining.\", He doesn\'t understand why so many parents and school leaders want to make masks a political matter when there are lives -- including children\'s lives -- at stake, he said. , \"They mislead the general public, and the general public ends up in the hospital where we\'re seeing them. I don\'t understand how ...\" he said, his voice trailing off before he apologized for his frustration. , Cobb County is an outlier in the Atlanta area. Clayton, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties are requiring masks in schools, as is the city of Atlanta. Cobb County Manager Jackie McMorris announced Tuesday that masks will be required in all county facilities, an order that doesn\'t include schools., The county Department of Public Health has issued guidance, recommending the school district follow the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s guidelines, but also saying, \"Each school system has their own unique challenges to meet the needs of students and faculty and we respect their authority to make the final decisions.\", District Director Janet Memark was not available for an interview, spokeswoman Valerie Crow said in an email reiterating the department\'s double-sided guidance. Asked if Memark worried the district\'s refusal to heed CDC guidance could create a larger public health problem for the county, Crow did not reply. , Toll on parents, Nooshin Johnson, a mother of two sons, 6 and 11, attending Cobb County schools, said the district policy is affecting her own health. , The first week of school, her youngest, who has asthma, came home upset because a teacher made him sit next to an unmasked child and wouldn\'t let him change seats. This, despite Cobb schools saying social distancing would be implemented when feasible. , \"He was crying, scared to go back to school,\" she said. \"I can only imagine what Covid would do if he caught it.\", She picked the boys up at lunchtime that first week so they wouldn\'t have to dine in a crowded lunchroom, but as cases spiked and her children came home with headaches and stomachaches, she took them out of school last week. , She understands the push for in-person learning -- and concedes she can\'t provide what her sons receive in a classroom -- but she\'s debating if she\'ll send them back, even after their Covid-19 tests came back negative. She feels guilty taking them somewhere she doesn\'t believe they\'re safe, she said. , Today, her blood pressure is soaring and her heartbeat is irregular -- problems she\'s never had before -- and she\'s seeing a cardiologist for the first time. She underwent two days of heart tests last week, she said, and her primary care physician told her he\'s seeing many parents succumb to stress this back-to-school season. , \"It feels like we\'re living in a dictatorship with this Cobb County school board,\" Johnson said. \"I feel like, is this a game with kids\' lives?\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/19/health/cobb-county-schools-georgia-covid/index.html',1,268),(197,'Covid-19 antibody treatments work, but they\'re \'not the path out of this pandemic\'','When Texas Gov. Greg Abbott Monoclonal antibodies such as those made by Regeneron and GlaxoSmithKline won\'t work for every Covid-19 patient; mAbs, as they are known, are only available for people age 12 and older and who aren\'t hospitalized or severely ill. , Regeneron\'s therapy can also be used for some people who know they were exposed to the virus, but don\'t yet have a positive test. That protection doesn\'t last long, though, and it\'s not a replacement for the vaccine., With his Regeneron treatment, Abbott joined a list of high-profile conservatives, including Chris Christie, Rudy Giuliani and President Donald Trump, who relied on the therapy., Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis who, like Abbott, has banned vaccine passports and limited mandates on masks in schools, has been promoting the treatments at events. Florida also created a rapid response unit to administer the treatments to residents infected with the virus. , \"These monoclonal antibodies, Regeneron and others, have proven to radically reduce the chance that somebody ends up being hospitalized and at the end of the day, reducing hospital admissions is got to be a top priority and if you reduce those admissions, people don\'t go to the hospital to begin with, you know they\'re going to recover and so that\'s a really important thing,\" said DeSantis, a Republican., The treatments are effective at reducing severe disease; however, some scientists have been critical of the push for these treatments over other, easier prevention methods., \"We know what works to prevent people from contracting this disease in the first place, masking and vaccination. We should be focusing on these preventive measures,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. \"It\'s totally backwards to say that we should be focused on treatment instead of emphasizing prevention, and the steps that we know work to stop Covid-19 in the first place.\", Here\'s what you should know about monoclonal antibodies for Covid-19., What is a monoclonal antibody?, Monoclonal antibodies are lab-made proteins, that can mimic the immune system\'s ability to fight off threats like the coronavirus., When a patient is infected it takes a little while for their body to produce antibodies that can help them fight the infection. These treatments, also known as mAbs, can speed up the body\'s ability to fight infection. , Two mAbs made specifically to fight the coronavirus are in use in the United States right now. , The US Food and Drug Administration gave an emergency use authorization to a treatment made by Regeneron called casirivimab and imdevimab, and another made by GlaxoSmithKline called sotrovimab. So far, none have received full FDA approval. , In April, the FDA revoked its emergency use authorization and put a pause on the distribution of Eli Lilly\'s antibody treatment bamlanivimab since it wasn\'t as effective against variants in circulation in the US. In June, HHS announced a pause in the distribution of Lilly\'s other treatment etesevimab, as well as its combination of the two monoclonals, as neither worked as well against the Gamma and Beta coronavirus variants., Can they prevent Covid-19?, The antibody therapy made by Regneron is also authorized to be used as a preventative treatment, or what\'s known as a post-exposure prophylaxis., It can be given to someone who has been exposed to an infectious person, or it can be given to someone who is at a high risk of exposure, like people who live in a nursing home that has had a recent case., As prevention, the mAbs are meant to be used in patients who are not fully vaccinated, or in people who are not expected to mount an adequate immune response to a vaccine -- like people who have had an organ transplant and are immunocompromised. , Who can get monoclonal antibody treatments for Covid-19?, The treatments for people infected with Covid-19 are for non-hospitalized adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older who have a risk of getting severe Covid-19., Monoclonal antibodies are meant to be used early in the course of the disease to keep it from progressing. A patient who is sick should get the treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis and within 10 days of symptom onset. , Studies show monoclonals don\'t seem to work when people are sicker and already in the hospital or on oxygen., How does someone access the treatment?, The drugs don\'t come in a simple pill, so they wouldn\'t typically be available at the average doctor\'s office, but a doctor can prescribe them. , The mAbs have to be given by an infusion or, if getting an infusion would cause a delay in treatment, the Regeneron treatment can also be given by four subcutaneous injections., The infusion itself can take about an hour and then patients need to wait for an observation period to make sure there are no side effects., How effective are the treatments?, Studies show mAbs are highly effective at preventing high-risk patients from developing severe Covid-19 symptoms., In March, Regeneron announced patients who got its treatment within 10 days had a 70% reduced risk of hospitalization and death.  , GlaxoSmithKline\'s resulted in an 85% reduction in risk of hospitalization or death in high-risk patients compared to placebo., As a prevention tool, a Regeneron study showed 72% protection against symptomatic infection in the first week, and 93% protection in subsequent weeks. Among the people who did have symptoms, those on the treatment cleared the virus faster and had a shorter time being sick., Are there side effects?, Allergic reactions are unlikely, but possible. Worsening symptoms after treatment can also happen, according to the FDA., How much do the treatments cost?, The US has spent more than $2 billion on monoclonal antibody treatment doses. But as of now, the treatment is free to patients, although there may be an administration fee. , Are the treatments hard to get?, For months, the government has tried to promote the use of mAbs, yet the US Department of Health and Human Services said as of August 6, the latest date it has figures for,that only about half of the distributed supply has been used. , \"At this time, there is plenty of product available for existing and new sites,\" a spokesperson for HHS told CNN last week., As coronavirus cases have surged recently, the US has seen a 1,200% increase in orders for monoclonal antibody treatments in the past month, according to HHS. About 75% of the orders are coming from regions of the US that have low vaccination rates., HHS also said it has seen a recent increase in the number of doctors using the treatments. Earlier in the year, the federal government had sent thousands of doses to states, but many sat on the shelf due to the complicated logistics of administering the treatments., During the pandemic, health officials have acknowledged that doctors don\'t always know as much about these treatments, and patients have had to push to get them, or drive long distances to find a center that will administer them., What\'s the difference between mAbs and a vaccine?, The protection from an antibody treatments doesn\'t last as long as a vaccine though. Typically the treatment would only provide protection for about a month. , A vaccine takes a couple of weeks for the immune system to start providing protection, but monoclonal antibodies work right away., If there\'s treatment for Covid-19, why do we need vaccines or other prevention methods?, The treatments aren\'t a cure, and they aren\'t an option for every Covid-19 patient., \"The antibodies are an important complement to treatment options, but it is not the path out of this pandemic,\" Wen says. \"There\'s only a small subset of patients who would qualify for monoclonal antibody treatment. Also, it is resource intensive, time intensive to administer. , \"The way out of this pandemic is through vaccination and preventive measures to stop you from getting Covid in the first place.\" ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/18/health/covid-19-antibody-treatments-wellness/index.html',1,269),(198,'7 ways to support kids\' immune systems as they return to school and wait for the Covid vaccine','As kids return to Add to that list this year: a deadly pandemic, with some symptoms that can mimic other illnesses. As children head to school now, Covid-19 cases are surging and children under age 12 currently cannot be vaccinated against the virus., Having a well-functioning immune system supported by lifestyle habits such as eating nutritious foods, exercising and sleeping could help reduce Covid-19 risk, according to guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., At the same time, no single food will totally prevent someone from catching coronavirus or cure the disease, the World Health Organization has said., \"We do know that people (who are) immune compromised are more likely to contract Covid and to get severely ill,\" said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. \"We don\'t know the degree to which improving your immunity would ward off Covid in some way. That might make common sense, but we don\'t have the data to say that that\'s the case. However, from a common sense perspective, we should be doing everything we can to improve health anyway.\", Because the immune system involves multiple functions that take place throughout the body, supporting it requires some basic building blocks, said Julie Stefanski, a registered dietitian and nutritionist and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Here are seven ways you can support your child\'s immune system with hygiene, food, rest and more.  , 1. Encourage personal hygiene, Protecting your child from illness begins with trying your best to prevent him from being exposed to infectious agents in the first place, said Dr. Maya Adam, a clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford University in California., \"That involves really, really keeping up on the hygiene practices,\" Adam said. \"Handwashing is huge. It\'s the number one thing that we can teach our kids to wash their hands frequently, as much as their setting allows. And as much as is recommended in their location, follow the guidelines on masking and social distancing. Try and be sensible about not being in large groups, especially if there are potential sources of infection.\", Encourage hand washing when your kids get home from school or when they are about to eat, said Julia Zumpano, a registered and licensed dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Unless it\'s shower night, have them wash their hands and faces before bed, too, she added., 2. Follow immunization schedules , Children under 12 currently can\'t be vaccinated against coronavirus but following schedules for other immunizations is critical for all children\'s long-term health, Adam said. Ask your child\'s pediatrician what vaccines are necessary for her at this stage of her life, Zumpano recommended., \"(I\'m) encouraging parents to trust in the fact that the reason we don\'t have polio cases, for example, is because a vaccine was introduced for that,\" Adam said. If and when your children are eligible, getting them vaccinated against coronavirus is key to both keeping them healthy and ending this pandemic., \"The minute that (Covid-19) vaccine is available and approved for under 12, my 11-year-old is going to be one of the first, I hope, to get it, because I think vaccines are part of our general health practice,\" Adam added. \"It\'s like brushing and flossing our teeth at night. It\'s like getting enough sleep and eating balanced nutrition.\", 3. Feed them the rainbow , When it comes to using food to support immune function, one method all these experts advised is balanced nutrition., \"A lot of parents just shudder when they hear it, because there\'s so much confusion about \'What does that actually mean? What do I need to do?\'\" said Adam, who is also author of \"Food Love Family: A Practical Guide to Child Nutrition.\" \"If you do one thing for your kids in terms of nutrition,\" she added, increase the variety of fruits and vegetables as much as your budget allows., Zinc and B, C and A vitamins are a few other micronutrients that help immune cells fight infection, said Dr. Mark Corkins, the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition. Zinc-rich foods include oysters, red meat, poultry, nuts and seafood. Foods such as salmon, organ meats, green leafy vegetables and dairy products provide vitamin A. All food groups contain varying levels of B vitamins. And citrus fruits, broccoli, strawberries and tomatoes are rich in vitamin C., Make healthier food options visible and accessible for kids by having fruits already peeled and on the counter to \"catch their hunger\" during snack times, Adam said. At dinner, ensure a vegetable is at least present or offered, Stefanski said., 4. Promote gut health, The microbiome in our gastrointestinal tract helps regulate how our immune system works, said Corkins, who\'s also a St. Jude Chair of Excellence in pediatric gastroenterology and a professor at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Foods with microbiome-supporting probiotics include yogurt, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut and sourdough bread, Adam said. , Stefanski recommended eating foods in their whole forms as often as possible since \"gut bacteria is nourished by certain fibers in the diet.\", 5. Prioritize sleep, Sleep is when bodies regenerate, so helping your kids maintain a healthy sleep routine is also essential for immune function, Zumpano said., Young children could relax by being read to or brought along on a slow, outdoor walk before bed, Adam suggested. Older kids might enjoy winding down by listening to meditation app audios or stories., \"Start that routine even an hour before they\'re supposed to be sleeping so it just helps them transition into that phase better,\" she added. \"I don\'t think our kids have ever heard the ends of those wind downs because they\'re asleep by the time it\'s finished.\", , Additionally, a room that\'s dark and cool is most conducive to getting adequate sleep, Stefanski said. The American Academy of Pediatrics has details on how much sleep children need depending on age., 6. Help them reduce stress, Since research has shown chronic stress is a depressant for the immune system, keeping an eye on your kid\'s mental health via quality time, discussions during activities and mental health professionals is also important for supporting immunity, Adam said. , \"I know this sounds impossible,\" Adam said, but \"if you\'re going to eat, try and time it so that you can eat with your kids and talk to them. There\'s a lot of research that\'s been done on mealtimes and how beneficial that is for kids\' mental health, because it gives them a regular forum where they can bring up things. ... It\'s much less effective to go to a child and say, \'Is anything bothering you?\'\" , 7. Get them outside, Since exercising releases mood-boosting chemicals, the following reduction in stress can support immune strength, Zumpano said. , \"Young kids should be playing mostly, but having them outdoors as much as possible, running around, playing whatever they love doing shouldn\'t feel like a punishment, but something they can engage in a safe way,\" Adam said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/19/health/how-to-build-kids-immune-system-covid-pandemic-wellness/index.html',1,270),(199,'Here\'s why fully vaccinated people might need boosters -- five takeaways from the White House booster announcement','It sounds confusing -- federal health officials say the Covid-19 vaccines are working well, providing more than 90% protection against severe disease and death. They\'re keeping people out of the hospitals.Yet they also say studies are showing that even vaccinated people are more likely to become infected now, so they are laying plans now for providing boosters, if federal regulators give the go-ahead., How can both be true?, It\'s because of a triple whammy of naturally waning immunity, a fast moving new variant, and a population that\'s been slow to get vaccinated in the first place., The coronavirus vaccines, especially the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, are remarkably effective -- providing upwards of 90% effectiveness against infections that cause symptoms., , , But it\'s important to remember that vaccines do not stop the virus cold., \"Some people think that if they are vaccinated, there is some sort of force field surrounding them,\" said Scott Hensley, an immunologist and microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania., However, if virus is in the air, even vaccinated people will breathe it in. What immunity does is control what happens after that., Antibodies matter, The first line of immunity comes in the form of antibodies. These proteins can attach to an invader like a virus, and either make it harder for it to attack cells, or completely neutralize it., A vaccine boosts levels of these antibodies, and trains the body to produce antibodies specifically designed to stop a pathogen such as coronavirus., Antibodies can stop viral infection quickly., This production starts to wane over time, in no small part because the body needs to make antibodies against other invaders, and there\'s only so much room., Plus, some of the new variants have evolved mutations that help them evade antibodies., \"With some variants the virus may actually be able to get into cells and replicate for a round or two,\" Hensley said., , That may be what\'s happening in the US. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published two studies Wednesday that showed immunity fell among people over the summer. While the vaccines still were 90% protective against severe disease and death, the number of people getting mild or asymptomatic infections grew., \"Recent data makes clear that protection against mild and moderate disease has decreased over time. This is likely due to both waning immunity and the strength of the widespread Delta variant,\" US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told a White House briefing Wednesday, One study of nursing home residents showed immunity from any kind of infection fell from 75% in March to 53% in August., But a third dose of vaccine boosts these antibody levels tenfold, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the briefing. \"Higher levels of antibody may be required to protect against Delta,\" he said., A second line of defense, There is a second line of defense involved -- the cellular response. , Viruses attach to certain cells in the body and inject their own genetic material into them, hijacking the cells\' natural functions and forcing them to become virus factories. , Immune cells called T cells can recognize these hijacked cells and work together to kill them before they produce more virus. B cells set up a longer-lasting production of antibodies, and can help recognize and neutralize viruses, also., This longer-term immune response is likely what keeps people out of the hospital, Hensley said. B cells and T cells cannot prevent infection, but they nip it in the bud, before people become severely ill., \"The virus is cleared much more effectively in vaccinated individuals,\" Hensley said., , , This is where some of the debate over the need for boosters comes in. The World Health Organization and some infectious diseases experts note that the vaccines are still doing their most important job—preventing severe disease and death. , \"The third dose will likely do very little for further boosting the vaccine\'s ability to reduce hospitalizations and deaths. That\'s because the vaccine is already pretty darn good at that,\" Hensley said., But federal health officials said while there\'s no indication this second level of protection has started to wane in the US, data from Israel hints that it may have begun to happen there. Because Israel vaccinated most of its population quickly, US officials are looking to surveillance there to predict what might happen in other countries., New variants, The Delta variant now accounts for 99% of newly diagnosed infections in the US, according to CDC data. It\'s clearly more transmissible than earlier variants. This on its own could account for the new cases, but there\'s growing evidence it can bypass that first line of defense set up by antibodies., \"Vaccine effectiveness is generally decreased against the Delta variant,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told the White House briefing., To support this idea, Walensky cited so-called cohort studies -- which are studies that follow the same group of people over time. , One, covering 4,000 healthcare workers and other first responders, found vaccine effectiveness against either symptomatic or asymptomatic infection fell from 92% prior to the arrival of Delta to 64% once it became widespread.   , What made CDC think Delta was responsible was this: it didn\'t matter when these volunteers were vaccinated -- it was the arrival of Delta that made them more likely to become infected., The air we breathe, No vaccinated person would be at risk of a breakthrough infection if the virus wasn\'t still circulating., Coronavirus is airborne, and as long as people are unprotected and breathing, they\'ll spread it., \"Even if you\'re vaccinated, we still all breathe the same air,\" Hensley said. , \"Our chances of actually breathing in SARS-CoV-2, whether you are vaccinated or not, is still the same.\", That\'s why the CDC has called for even vaccinated people to start wearing masks again indoors, when they might be exposed to spread. , \"It\'s the only way you are going to prevent the virus from going up your nose,\" Hensley said., And while no study has shown this yet, there\'s a growing belief among scientists that it takes a smaller dose of Delta to infect people than with previous variants. So even if there\'s just a small amount of virus floating in the air, if people breathe it in, they may be more likely to become infected. , And any infected person might infect someone else. Coronavirus can be spread by people who do not have symptoms., However, vaccinated people almost certainly clear that infection more quickly. \"The overwhelming majority of hospitalizations and death continue to occur among the unvaccinated,\" Murthy noted., Herd immunity, So health officials, doctors and nurses across the country are clamoring for more Americans to get vaccinated and WHO is pushing for more vaccines to be distributed to the rest of the world., So long as people are becoming infected with coronavirus and spreading it, the virus will infect some vaccinated people. And it will evolve into new forms, perhaps versions that can more easily evade the vaccines., , That\'s what herd immunity is about -- when enough people are immune to infection that a virus stops circulating. This usually only happens with widespread vaccination.,  The US Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must make the decision to give people booster shots, but White House officials said they wanted to have a plan ready to go if and when that happens. , \"We\'re not saying you need a booster dose right now,\" Walensky told CNN Wednesday evening., \"We\'re saying we\'re starting to see waning in vaccine effectiveness against moderate and mild disease and we\'re preparing for the month ahead because we\'ve seen in other countries that that could portend waning for severe disease.\", ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/18/health/vaccine-boosters-5-takeaways/index.html',1,271),(200,'If you live in a state with a low vaccination rate, you\'re 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and more than 5 times more likely to die','A vast majority of US residents live in an area with high In the 10 states with the lowest vaccination rates, fewer than 41% of their residents have been fully vaccinated.

Data from the US Department of Health and Human Services shows an average of 39 people hospitalized with Covid-19 for every 100,000 residents in those states, compared to 10 for every 100,000 in the top 10 vaccinated states., The top states with high vaccination rates are Vermont, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Washington and New York., In the 10 states with the lowest vaccination rates, there is an average of about 34 deaths per 1 million residents, and in states with the highest, the average is six deaths per 1 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. , CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Wallensky said at the news conference that the country is averaging about 500 Covid-19 deaths a day -- deaths that \"remain largely preventable.\", \"In areas with low vaccination coverage, we continue to hear far too many heartbreaking stories of people who did not get vaccinated, only then to get severe Covid-19,\" she said. \"In these areas, the data are showing us that the more people who are in the hospital, and tragically, more people are dying of Covid-19.\", Child Covid-19 cases are steadily increasing as schools reopen, As Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations surge in the US, a health expert is warning that an accompanying rise in cases among children, many of whom aren\'t yet eligible to be vaccinated, will only worsen as schools resume classes., That warning comes as top US health officials announced their intention -- subject to pending regulatory decisions -- to soon start allowing booster shots for any adult who\'d received two mRNA Covid-19 vaccine shots., As for youths: More than 121,000 child Covid-19 cases were reported in the US last week -- more than 14 times the weekly number in late June, when the figure was at the low point for 2021, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported this week., This likely is just the start of what is to come, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. , \"This is happening before school starts. Schools are opening now,\" Hotez told CNN\'s Jake Tapper on Tuesday. \"So, Houston Independent school district opens August 23. That\'s going to be a huge accelerant. ... This is just the beginning, unfortunately.\", Though the rise in children\'s cases coincides with the surges among the broader US public since early summer, the proportion of child cases is up. Child cases represented 18% of the US total last week, against 14.4% over the whole pandemic, AAP says., Health experts had hoped to get a critical threshold of the population vaccinated against Covid-19 in time to get spread under control for the new school year, but only 51% of the population is fully vaccinated. , And with the more transmissible Delta variant accounting now for nearly 99% of cases in the US, the situation is growing particularly dangerous for children, experts said. , They have advocated for children to wear masks in school, but some governors have attempted to ban such requirements. , \"Why tie the hands of the public health officials behind their backs? You have two weapons here, one is vaccines, the other is masking, and for children less than 12 that\'s the only weapon they have,\" Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the US Food and Drug Administration\'s vaccine advisory committee, told CNN\'s Erin Burnett on Tuesday., Hotez said the US is now at a \"screaming level of virus transmission,\" adding that to really interrupt the spread, 80 to 85% of the population will need to be vaccinated., Boosters planned for adult mRNA vaccine recipients, On Wednesday, the US surgeon general announced a plan to allow booster shots to any American adult, age 18 and older, who already had received two doses of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines., That plan still depends on whether the US Food and Drug Administration authorizes boosters and whether the CDC\'s immunization advisory committee recommends those boosters, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said., Under the plan, adult mRNA vaccine recipients would be eligible for a booster eight months after receiving their second dose, starting the week of September 20, Murthy said during the White House Covid-19 news conference., As for the people who received the other Covid-19 vaccine authorized in the US -- the one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson product -- more data needs to be collected before a booster is recommended for them, Murthy said., The plan to authorize an mRNA booster comes as data suggests that protection against mild and moderate disease from the first two doses appears to decline over time, Murthy said., He emphasized coronavirus vaccines still appear to be effective in protecting against severe Covid-19, hospitalization and death., But, \"we are concerned that this pattern of decline we are seeing (in protections against mild and moderate disease) will continue in the months ahead, which could lead to reduced protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death,\" Murthy said., On Monday, Pfizer and BioNTech said they submitted initial data to the FDA to support the use of a booster. Their data indicated a booster dose elicited a significantly higher antibody response against the initial strain of coronavirus and the Delta and Beta variants compared to what was seen among people who got two doses. , Last week, the FDA authorized third doses for some people who are immunocompromised, and the CDC almost immediately recommended giving those doses. , As the Delta variant increased its grip in the US this summer, coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths have jumped., The US averaged more than 137,500 new daily cases over the past week -- an average that is more than 11 times higher than it was two months ago, when the figure was nearing its lowest point of the year, according to Johns Hopkins University., More than 88,300 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals Tuesday, nearly five times higher than two months ago, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. And the US averaged 734 Covid-19 deaths a day over the past week, more than double the average seen two months ago, according to Johns Hopkins., , Thousands of students already quarantining, Many schools that have gone back to campus are already seeing the impact of the spread of the virus., More than 3,000 students and employees have been quarantined in the New Orleans Public School District because of Covid-19 cases in the past week, according to the district\'s latest tally., They represent 5.89% of the students and teachers in the district., Students returned to the New Orleans Public School District on August 12 and are required to wear masks in school facilities, according to the district., Mask mandates have caused tension in Florida as some schools press to implement them but are going up against Gov. Ron DeSantis\' ban against such requirements. , Among the state\'s 15 largest school districts, at least 4,641 students and 1,547 employees have tested positive for coronavirus and at least another 19,072 students and staff members have been quarantined or isolated because of Covid-19., The tallies do not include any cases from the two biggest school districts in Florida -- Miami-Dade and Broward. Miami-Dade begins classes August 23. Broward started Wednesday., On Tuesday, Florida\'s State Board of Education voted unanimously to recommend investigations into the Broward and Alachua districts over their requirements for mask-wearing in school., In Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey said the state would use federal Covid relief money to increase the funding available to public school districts only if they\'re open for in-person learning and don\'t require children to wear masks., , A handful of Arizona districts have imposed mask mandates despite the state law that prohibits them, arguing the ban cannot go into effect until mid-September at the earliest, making their current mandates legal., In Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee announced a policy that requires everyone who works at an academic institution in the state to be vaccinated by October 18., \"We won\'t gamble with the health of our children, our educators and school staff, nor the health of the communities they serve,\" Inslee said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/18/health/us-coronavirus-wednesday/index.html',1,273),(201,'As additional mRNA shots roll out, Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine recipients told to wait','The calls and emails about Covid-19 boosters have already started coming in to It started last week, when the US Food and Drug Administration and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended an additional dose for certain immunocompromised people who had been given the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines., Then, on Monday, Biden administration officials said they are working on a plan to recommend more Americans get a booster about eight months after being fully vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. The question will be addressed during a White House Covid-19 briefing on Wednesday., But nearly 14 million fully vaccinated people in the United States didn\'t get one of those mRNA vaccines. They got the single-dose shot from Johnson &amp; Johnson, and so far, they are not a part of this booster conversation., \"Our J&amp;J patients have not been overlooked or neglected. It\'s just the way the data are coming in,\" said Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. , For J&amp;J vaccine patients who are calling and emailing about boosters, he is telling them to wait. , \"You can\'t make good recommendations without the data,\" he said., Last month, J&amp;J researchers reported the vaccine provides immunity that lasts at least eight months and possibly longer. , The J&amp;J vaccine also appears to provide adequate protection against the Delta variant, the predominant strain of the virus making people sick in the United States today. J&amp;J said in July that a second or booster dose of its vaccine would not be necessary at that time., However, a spokesperson from Johnson &amp; Johnson told CNN on Tuesday the company is gathering additional data to see if booster shots are necessary. , \"Ensuring long-term and durable protection against hospitalization and death are critical in curbing the Covid-19 pandemic,\" the company said in an email to CNN. \"Johnson &amp; Johnson continues to diligently generate and evaluate evidence from ongoing trials as well as emerging real-world evidence as it assesses the need for a booster of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\" , Different vaccines, different studies, different timelines, Many vaccines need more than one shot to provide full protection. Some, like a tetanus shot, need an additional boost every 10 years or so because immunity wanes over time. Others, like the flu shot, need to be administered annually because each flu season bring new strains. , With Covid-19, scientists are still figuring out how long protection lasts and how the vaccines work against different variants. All of that will need to be determined by more research., For mRNA vaccines, more data is coming in. Pfizer said Monday that it has submitted initial data to support the use of boosters to the FDA. Moderna said last week it\'s still in the process of submitting its data., The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine works a little differently than the mRNA vaccines, which use a newer technology that delivers genetic material directly into cells via fatty particles. J&amp;J\'s Janssen vaccine uses a viral vector, a common cold virus that is genetically engineered to infect cells, but won\'t replicate and spread in the body. It delivers genetic instructions to the cells, then trains them to identify and protect against the coronavirus. , Johnson &amp; Johnson has always been on a different timeline, too. When Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna were authorized in December, J&amp;J was still gathering data. It got its emergency use authorization a couple of months later, in February., And while there\'s evidence immunocompromised people may benefit from a third dose of an mRNA vaccine, it\'s still not clear if immunocompromised people who received the J&amp;J vaccine would benefit from getting another dose. , \"We have been reviewing the science and data on a near daily basis to evaluate whether or when boosters may be needed,\" the CDC said in an email to CNN when asked about boosters for the general public and for the immunocompromised on Tuesday. , \"As we have been saying, boosters would probably be needed. We will be announcing more detailed plans soon, so we\'ll have more to share then. This will all be done in accordance with independent FDA and CDC review and recommendations.\", Mixing and matching vaccines, It\'s also not clear if people who got J&amp;J\'s vaccine and who need a boost would benefit more from an additional J&amp;J vaccine, or should receive a different vaccine type., Currently, the CDC\'s official stance is that people should stick with the shot they got initially. It says there isn\'t enough data to know if mixing and matching works and is safe., , In parts of Europe, though, doctors are mixing and matching the single dose AstraZeneca vaccine -- which is similar to the J&amp;J vaccine -- with an mRNA vaccine. , In Germany, health officials recommended people who got a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine get an mRNA vaccine for their second dose. Early studies showed the mix generated a robust immune response. In June, German Chancellor Angela Merkel led the way and got the Moderna vaccine following her first dose of the AstraZeneca., In the United States, at least one city didn\'t wait for data on whether to boost the J&amp;J vaccine. , People vaccinated with the J&amp;J vaccine can get a supplemental mRNA vaccine dose in San Francisco, where Department of Public Health officials made an \"accommodation\" for those who have consulted with a doctor, the department said August 4. , , While Schaffner is enthusiastically encouraging anyone who has not yet gotten a first shot to get one immediately, for patients who got the J&amp;J vaccine and want a booster, he\'s counseling patience. , \"At the moment, the only thing we can tell them is sit tight,\" Schaffner said. \"More information is on the way.\" ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/17/health/johnson-covid-booster-wait-wellness/index.html',1,274),(202,'As Covid-19 cases rise among teens, so do vaccinations, CNN analysis finds','More adolescents have received Covid-19 vaccinations in the past two weeks -- representing about a fifth of all new vaccinations in the United States, data suggest. Public health experts call the increase in vaccinations good, but the cause may be grim., , The rise in Covid-19 vaccinations among adolescents parallels an increase in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, mostly fueled by the Delta variant -- leading some experts to speculate that parents who were once hesitant to get their children vaccinated are now reconsidering their decision after seeing more young people falling ill., Over the course of the summer, the Covid-19 case rate among adolescents grew nearly five times. In June, there were 3.4 cases per 100,000 adolescents ages 12 to 15, which nearly tripled to about 9 cases per 100,000 adolescents in July and up to 14.6 cases per 100,000 adolescents in August, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, last updated on Monday., At the same time, that age group represented 30.9% of people receiving at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine in June, rising to 38.9% in July and 44.9% in August. Children ages 12 to 15 account for just 5% of the population overall. , The share of fully vaccinated people who are ages 12 to 15 also saw an increase, climbing from 21.5% in June to 28.7% in July to 32.2% in August. , Among older teens, ages 16 and 17, the average number of Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people increased from 4.27 in June to 11.37 in July to 17.28 per 100,000 in August, the CDC data show, as of Monday. , At the same time, that age group represented 43.5% of people receiving at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine in June, rising to 49.7% in July and 54.2% in August. The share of fully vaccinated people who are in that age group climbed from 34.6% in June to 40.1% in July to 42.7% in August. , This means there are still millions of adolescents heading back to school this month unvaccinated, but they are a dwindling group within the roughly 25 million 12- to 17-year-olds in the United States., Overall, about 8 million or 32% of all adolescents ages 12 to 17 are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. , \'They realize that it\'s necessary to protect them\', Ishaan Mishra, 13, remembers being among some of the first US teenagers to wait in line at a local Walgreens in San Francisco for the vaccine in May. That month, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for adolescents as young as 12.  , , \"We got it relatively early when it was released and there were definitely a few other teenagers, so people above the age of 12 there waiting in line, and I was overall definitely excited,\" Ishaan told CNN on Tuesday, remembering the moment. , \"It helped with my friends feeling safer interacting with me,\" he said about getting vaccinated. \"I\'d get to see them more.\" , Now, several months later, Ishaan will be starting 8th grade on September 1, and he said that many of his peers still have positive opinions about the Covid-19 vaccine. , \"They realize that it\'s necessary to protect them,\" Ishaan said. , Some of his friends and he worry about possible breakthrough cases of Covid-19 due to the Delta variant, he added. But being fully vaccinated, Ishaan knows the vaccine provides protection against severe disease if a breakthrough case were to happen. , \"I believe that it is very important to be vaccinated before the school year starts,\" Ishaan said. \"There\'s always a possibility that you can get Covid-19 and you want to protect yourself as much as possible.\" , When Ishaan was vaccinated in May, it was his mother, Dr. Monica Gandhi, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of California, San Francisco, who took him to Walgreens for his first dose. , Before taking Ishaan back to the pharmacy for his second dose, Gandhi said that she first waited until the June 23 ACIP meeting to hear the results of data reporting myocarditis cases in young males who had received the vaccine. , ACIP is the CDC\'s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a group of medical and public health experts that develop recommendations on how to use vaccines. , Vaccinations for 12- to 15-year-olds started out high soon after May 10, when the FDA authorized the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for that age group. In less than one week, 600,000 children in that group were vaccinated, according to data from the CDC. , But the numbers took a nosedive on May 23, the day after media articles appeared around the possible link to the vaccine and myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, in young people. Most cases of myocarditis were mild and typically resolved quickly. , In June, the FDA added a warning about the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart, to the fact sheets for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. , The CDC data showing the myocarditis cases to be mild were reassuring, Gandhi said, and so she took Ishaan for his second shot in June, about six weeks after his first dose. , \"We had a good experience,\" she said, adding that Ishaan experienced only \"mild side effects such as fatigue, arm soreness and mild fever after the second shot.\" , What\'s driving the increase in vaccinations?, Even though vaccinations among adolescents plunged following the myocarditis reports, data suggest vaccinations are now back on the rise. , , \"In my opinion, and from what I have seen amongst my teenage patients, many are eager to now get vaccinated because they understand the urgency of doing this before the school year starts,\" said Dr. Priya Soni, assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles., \"This reasoning, combined with the understanding that the Delta variant is propelling this pandemic into another surge, they are now more eager than ever to rely on what science has taught us time and time again: vaccines work,\" Soni said. \"Ultimately in weighing the pros and cons of starting the school year without the protection against Covid-19, many teens and parents are taking the plunge that sets them up for the best chance at a successful, healthy school year.\", About 1 million adolescents ages 12 to 17 so far have completed at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine in the past two weeks, representing around 19% of all people in the US who have received at least one shot recently, according to CDC data. , \"It is hard to know what is driving the increased vaccinations but likely is related to the recognition among young people that the highly transmissible Delta variant is driving another significant surge, especially among younger individuals who are less likely to be vaccinated,\" Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, chief of the division of infectious diseases in the Department of Pediatrics at Stanford Medicine and a committee chair with the American Academy of Pediatrics, wrote in an email to CNN on Monday. , Maldonado called the recent rise in Covid-19 vaccinations among adolescents \"promising.\" , \"It is always encouraging to see populations seek the benefits of safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 as well as for other infectious diseases. While we do still have a way to go to increase our vaccination numbers, this is a promising trend,\" Maldonado said. , \"I do think that the much anticipated reopening of schools is one factor that is encouraging families to get all of their eligible members to be vaccinated,\" she said. \"There is no evidence, however, that school openings are driving new COVID-19 infections. These are a reflection of the highly transmissible infections occurring among unvaccinated adults in community settings.\" , The recent rise in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, fueled by the Delta coronavirus variant, appears to be driving vaccinations in younger people, Gandhi said. , \"Yes, I think the Delta wave and the increasing concern regarding children safety, especially as schools re-open, is driving this willingness of parents to get their children vaccinated or the adolescents themselves,\" said Gandhi, who also serves as director of the UCSF Center for AIDS Research. , \"I think this is very encouraging as the group most lagging in vaccinations was younger individuals, including adolescents,\" Gandhi said. \"The Delta variant has made younger people getting vaccinated even more urgent and I think it is encouraging to see a full 20% of those who completed vaccinations in the last 14 days being adolescents.\" , Ishaan, Gandhi\'s 13-year-old son, hopes that more people in his age group who haven\'t been vaccinated yet, roll up their sleeves soon. , \"This is the most effective way of stopping the pandemic because masks, they work, but they can\'t protect you from everything,\" Ishaan said.  , \"The vaccine is generally like 94% effective,\" he said. \"So definitely, that is one of the best options you can get when trying to protect yourself and the community from Covid-19.\" ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/18/health/covid-19-teens-vaccinations-rise-analysis-wellness/index.html',1,275),(203,'Covid-19 vaccine booster shots to be offered to Americans beginning September 20, health officials say','US health officials and medical experts \"We are prepared to offer booster shots for all Americans beginning the week of September 20 and starting 8 months after an individual\'s second dose,\" US health officials, including CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and FDA Acting Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock, said in the statement., \"At that time, the individuals who were fully vaccinated earliest in the vaccination rollout, including many health care providers, nursing home residents, and other seniors, will likely be eligible for a booster. We would also begin efforts to deliver booster shots directly to residents of long-term care facilities at that time, given the distribution of vaccines to this population early in the vaccine rollout and the continued increased risk that COVID-19 poses to them,\" the statement said., , The officials write that the authorized Covid-19 vaccines are \"remarkably effective in reducing risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death, even against the widely circulating Delta variant,\" but it\'s clear that protection against the coronavirus begins to decrease over time., \"Current protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death could diminish in the months ahead, especially among those who are at higher risk or were vaccinated during the earlier phases of the vaccination rollout,\" the statement said. \"For that reason, we conclude that a booster shot will be needed to maximize vaccine-induced protection and prolong its durability.\", , The statement was signed by Walensky, Woodcock, Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, Assistant Secretary for Health Dr. Rachel Levine, Chief Science Officer for the COVID Response Dr. David Kessler and Chair of the COVID Health Equity Task Force Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith., , While those initial booster doses will be for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, the officials noted in the statement that they anticipate booster shots will likely be needed for people who initially received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. \"Administration of the J&amp;J vaccine did not begin in the U.S. until March 2021, and we expect more data on J&amp;J in the next few weeks,\" the statement said. , The CDC also said on Wednesday that the FDA will review data on boosters among adolescents to determine when people younger than 18 will be part of the rollout., The officials ended the statement by noting that they continue to expand efforts to increase the supply of vaccines globally for other countries, \"building further on the more than 600 million doses we have already committed to donate globally.\", Booster plans are to \'stay ahead\' of the virus, The Biden administration\'s plans to administer booster doses of Covid-19  vaccine are an effort to \"stay ahead\" of the coronavirus, Murthy said during a virtual White House Covid-19 briefing on Wednesday., Murthy emphasized that coronavirus vaccines still appear to be effective in protecting against severe Covid-19, hospitalization and death -- but data suggest that protection against mild and moderate disease appears to decline over time, and US health officials want to boost protection before that decline in protection against severe disease., , \"We are concerned that this pattern of decline we are seeing will continue in the months ahead, which could lead to reduced protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death,\" Murthy said during Wednesday\'s briefing., Three separate studies demonstrate how protection against Covid-19 infection that vaccines provide may wane over time, Walensky said during the briefing., One of those studies, conducted in New York, found that vaccine effectiveness against new Covid-19 diagnoses declined from 92% to 80% over time from May 3 through July 25, based on the state\'s vaccine records., \"This allowed New York to study vaccine effectiveness against infection over time for more than 10 million New Yorkers of all ages,\" Walensky said. The data published in the CDC\'s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) on Wednesday., , Another study, conducted by the Mayo Clinic, analyzed vaccine effectiveness for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines among more than 80,000 people across all ages using data through July 16, Walensky said, adding, \"Like we saw in the New York data, vaccine effectiveness against infection declined over time.\", The Mayo Clinic study found that effectiveness fell from 76% to 42% among those who received the Pfizer vaccine and from 86% to 76% among those who received the Moderna vaccine. , A third study, published in the CDC\'s MMWR, found that vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 infection among nursing home residents declined from 75% in March to 53% in August, Walensky said., The researchers, from the CDC and Lantana Consulting Group in Vermont, wrote in the study that an \"additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine might be considered for nursing home and long-term care facility residents to optimize a protective immune response.\", , In all three studies, \"taken together, you can see that while the exact percentage of vaccine effectiveness over time differs depending on the cohort and setting studied, the data consistently demonstrate a reduction of vaccine effectiveness against infection over time,\" Walensky said. \"Despite waning vaccine effectiveness against infection, data analyzed through July continue to demonstrate a stable and highly effective protection against severe illness and hospitalization for people who are vaccinated.\", It is also \"conceivable\" that the planned rollout of booster shots could help reduce the spread of disease, Dr. Fauci said Wednesday., Although, \"transmissibility is a bit more tricky than looking at a clinical phenomenon, such as infection, seriousness of disease and hospitalization,\" Fauci said during the White House briefing., , But data show that a booster shot prompts the body to produce a new batch of antibodies, Fauci said. These catch the virus as it tries to enter the body, and could stop the virus from multiplying in the nose and throat after someone breathes it in., \"The increase with a boost is really quite striking -- multiple-fold increase -- that it is conceivable that that would be important in lowering the level of virus in the nasopharynx, which could have an impact on transmission. I certainly hope that\'s the case,\" Fauci said., \"If it is, then you could really get multiple benefits from doing this. You can get benefits for disease, severity of disease, and then ultimately infection and transmission. But the bottom line with full transparency -- we don\'t know that right now.\", FDA and CDC to weigh in next, The White House\'s plan to offer booster shots to vaccinated adults starting September 20 still depends on whether the FDA authorizes boosters and whether the CDC\'s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends those boosters, Murthy said Wednesday., ACIP is a group of medical and public health experts that develop recommendations on how to use vaccines in the United States., , \"I want to be very clear: We are not skipping the very important FDA and ACIP process here. They have an incredibly important role to play in evaluating safety and making recommendations for vaccines. We respect that, we honor that and that will be a part of this process as well,\" Murthy told the White House briefing., White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters on Wednesday\'s Covid-19 briefing that boosters will be free and available at established vaccine sites. , \"It will be just as easy and convenient to get a booster shot as it is to get the first shot today,\" Zients said. \"We have enough vaccine supply for every American.\", Murthy said they made the announcement now for the sake of transparency, and to ensure boosters can roll out in an orderly way., \"We also want to ensure that people and states and localities and the public more broadly can plan,\" Murthy said. \"You can\'t turn on a booster effort with the flip of a switch.

Wen is an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She\'s also author of a new book, \"Lifelines: A Doctor\'s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.\" , CNN: Are boosters unusual when it comes vaccines?, Wen: Not at all. Let\'s first define what we mean when we say booster. Many vaccines require multiple doses to achieve the full immune effect. The polio vaccine, for example, requires four doses. The hepatitis vaccine requires three doses. These vaccines are a series, meaning that the second, third or fourth doses are needed to achieve full immune protection. Most people are done for a lifetime once they\'ve completed the full series. , There are other vaccines that require occasional \"boosts\" because immunity may wane over time. The tetanus-diphtheria vaccine is such an example. This is part of a series of childhood immunizations. Then, as adults, we are still supposed to receive this vaccine every 10 years. , , , There are other vaccines that need to be administered even more often. The influenza vaccine needs to be updated every year because there are so many new strains every season. This is not so much to boost our immunity, but because there are new strains targeted by the vaccine.  , Needing additional shots of a vaccine is not at all unusual. Covid-19 is a relatively new disease that\'s come about only in the last two years, and we don\'t yet know if one more dose is required because there needs to be say, a three-dose series like hepatitis; if there may be occasional \"boosts\" immunity like tetanus; or if new strains may emerge and we may need shots to target these strains. , CNN: Does a booster mean that the vaccine isn\'t working?, Wen: No. We are still learning about Covid-19, and it may be that a third booster shot is needed to finish the series, and after that, we don\'t need additional immunity. It may also be that immunity diminishes over time, and that an occasional booster will help increase immunity., The Covid-19 vaccines are safe and very effective. According to estimates from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, the vaccines protect us from severe illness by about 25 times. That\'s the biggest reason why we get vaccinated -- to reduce the likelihood of being hospitalized or dying. , , , Vaccination also reduces the chance of getting Covid-19 by about eight times. A vaccinated person is much less likely to get sick from Covid-19, compared to someone who is not vaccinated. That person is also therefore less likely to spread coronavirus. These are all very compelling reasons to get vaccinated -- to protect yourself and others around you., , , CNN: Are boosters safe?, Wen: Yes. We routinely receive additional shots for other vaccines. These studies of an additional booster dose are being carefully conducted in the US and other countries. Some other countries, like Israel and Germany, have already authorized third booster doses. If a Covid-19 booster is authorized, it will have been studied in many people to make sure it is safe., CNN: Who should be getting boosters at this time?, Wen: That\'s something our federal health officials are looking into now. They have already said that people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, who received the two-dose Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, can receive a third dose now. More guidance is expected soon for other groups. , , , For right now, I\'d advise that you speak with your doctor. The decision for a booster dose is probably not a one-size-fits-all recommendation, but an individualized decision depending on your medical circumstances., , , CNN: Some people may want to know what\'s the purpose of getting the vaccine if you have to get a booster later?, Wen: I understand this is a concern that some people raise, though there is a logical fallacy here. We don\'t say, well, what\'s the point of putting on a seatbelt today if I have to put on a seatbelt tomorrow, too? The vaccines protect you well. To have additional, ongoing protection, you may need a booster dose. Just because you may need more protection in the future, doesn\'t mean that you shouldn\'t get the initial protection afforded by the vaccine., Ultimately, the Covid-19 vaccine is what will protect us and our loved ones -- and is key to ending the pandemic. A booster may be needed, and we should get it if and when it is advised.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/17/health/why-boosters-covid-wen-wellness/index.html',1,278),(205,'One state has no available ICU beds while thousands more students quarantine due to Covid-19','Those unvaccinated against Covid-19 aren\'t just risking their own health -- they\'re also jeopardizing medical care for others and fueling a surge that\'s forcing more students to quarantine, doctors say.

','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/17/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html',1,279),(206,'ANALYSIS- Here\'s why there may be no need for boosters for everyone just yet','Biden administration officials say the federal government is thinking about offering boosters to people starting about eight months after they\'ve been fully vaccinated. But is it too soon to start talking about boosters for the general public?Last week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration authorized and recommended giving a third dose of vaccine to people with compromised immune systems -- not as a booster, but because their immune systems are unlikely to have responded properly to the first two doses of Moderna\'s of Pfizer\'s vaccines., States, cities and hospital systems have already begun offering these doses., , Then, Monday night, administration sources shocked the medical community by saying federal officials were leaning toward offering booster doses more generally to people. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that President Joe Biden will speak on Wednesday about  boosters after the White House Covid-19 response team and health and medical experts brief reporters about it., The FDA, the agency that would make the actual decision, declined to comment directly. \"FDA, CDC, and NIH are engaged in a science-based, rigorous process to consider when boosters might be necessary,\" the FDA told CNN in a statement Tuesday., While Pfizer, especially has been pushing for booster doses, and said Monday it had submitted data to FDA to support the idea, the FDA statement pushed back., \"This process takes into account laboratory data, clinical trial data, and cohort data -- which can include data from specific pharmaceutical companies, but does not rely on those data exclusively. We continue to review any new data as it becomes available and will keep the public informed,\" it said., The CDC also pushed back, saying while some immune compromised people need a third dose, there\'s not a clear need for boosters. , \"Other fully vaccinated individuals do not need an additional dose right now,\" the CDC\'s Dr. Kathleen Dooling, who leads the agency\'s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, told doctors and other medical providers on a call Tuesday., , , The FDA and CDC have been saying there is no clear argument yet for giving boosters to people with normal immune systems. While there are fresh surges of virus across the country, nearly all of the people becoming severely ill with Covid-19 now are completely unvaccinated., Scott Hensley, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania, said he was surprised at reports boosters were being considered for the general public., \"If you look at hospitalizations and deaths in the United States right now, they are almost exclusively in unvaccinated individuals,\" Hensley told CNN., \"If you want to reduce global deaths and hospitalizations, well, the answer is simple. You have got to get the vaccine people that haven\'t been vaccinated before. I am afraid a rollout of boosters in United States will take away efforts from getting the vaccine to the developing world.\", , , The World Health Organization agrees, and has been saying so in ever-stronger terms., \"What our recommendation is, is that all of the world\'s most vulnerable, and those who are most at risk, health workers, need to receive their first and second doses before large proportions of the population, or all of the population in some countries, receive that third dose,\" Maria van Kerkhove, WHO\'s technical lead for Covid-19, told CNN Tuesday., \"If you think a third dose of the vaccine is going to end the pandemic, then you are kidding yourself.\", , \"Of course we want people to be protected and to receive the full course. But what we are trying to move against is giving a third dose to people who already are well protected.\" , Plus, plenty of Americans -- around 90 million eligible people—remain unvaccinated. They\'re the main source of spread, Hensley noted., \"If you think a third dose of the vaccine is going to end the pandemic, then you are kidding yourself,\" he said., \"The way to end this pandemic is to get the vaccine distributed across the globe.\", , Virologist Andy Pekosz of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health agrees., \"Boosters don\'t preclude the fact that we need to get out there and get people vaccinated for the first time,\" Pekosz told CNN., \"We need to get people who\'ve been infected or feel they don\'t need to be vaccinated, we need to get them to get vaccinated because it\'s targeting those populations that is really going to help us control this pandemic,\" he added., Pekosz said it might make sense to offer booster doses to people most at risk of severe disease, such as the immune compromised or the very elderly, but not to the general population just yet., \"Booster shots are going to help us with severe disease. We control a pandemic by getting more of the population vaccinated,\" he said., , , Pfizer\'s argument for a booster rests on research that shows levels of immune system proteins called antibodies shoot up after people get a third dose. That\'s true, Hensley says., But the human immune system has other components, too, and it may not be the antibodies that are the most important when it comes to long-term immunity., \"Antibodies are sort of our first line of defense,\" Hensley said. \"If we have high levels, they can recognize the fires. That\'s what prevents the virus from even getting into our cells in the first place.\", The Delta variant of the virus appears to evade these antibodies to some degree. And antibody levels do wane over time -- even though studies show they stay at protective levels for six to eight months and possible longer after people get all three US authorized vaccine -- those made by Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson &amp; Johnson., Once those antibodies start to wane, the body relies on T cells, Hensley said., , \"T cells can\'t prevent infection. That\'s not how they work. But what they do is they get rapidly recruited and they clean up the infection, and they keep you out of the hospital and they keep you from dying,\" he said., That\'s why a third dose might not be needed for most people. Their T cells will protect them., \"The third vaccine dose, what it will probably do is it will boost antibody responses to a level that is very high and those antibodies will be at a higher level both against the original strain, as well as the Delta strain,\" Hensley said., \"Even if you are the most selfish person in the world, and you only care about yourself, you should still stand behind this idea of getting the vaccine distributed across the world.\", That looks good on paper, but in terms of real-life protection, it may not add much., \"The third dose will likely do very little for further boosting the vaccine\'s ability to protect against severe infections and deaths. And that\'s because it\'s already pretty darn good. If you\'re already 90-95% effective at preventing deaths, which the standard two dose regimen is, well, it\'s hard to get much better than that,\" Hensley noted., This is why it is more important to simply vaccinate more people. If more people are vaccinated, they will be breathing less virus into the air -- and the potential for breakthrough infections falls., , , So does the risk of new variants that may eventually develop the ability to completely evade vaccine protection., \"The only way that we won\'t have new variants is if we can limit the spread of the virus,\" Hensley said., \"Even if you are the most selfish person in the world, and you only care about yourself, you should still stand behind this idea of getting the vaccine distributed across the world, because it\'s the only way that you\'re going to limit new variants from emerging.\", Pekosz ageed., , , \"We need to think about this as a global disease, and make sure that the vaccines get out there to control virus replication anywhere, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. And that variant can make its way around the globe very, very quickly,\" he said., \"We\'ve seen that over and over again in just this short term of the pandemic.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/17/health/boosters-need-analysis/index.html',1,280),(207,'Child Covid-19 cases have \'steadily increased\' since the beginning of July, AAP says, with 121,000 new cases last week','More than 121,000 child Covid-19 cases were reported in the US in the last week, After declining in early summer, child cases have \"steadily increased\" since the beginning of July.

That fear is especially pressing as more children are being hospitalized with the virus, such as Kyle Butrum\'s 1-year-old son, Carter, in Arkansas., Butrum urged people to get vaccinated so other families don\'t have to watch their child struggle in the hospital., \"The only thing you can do to prevent someone else from doing this is to get your vaccine, so that another child doesn\'t have to do this, and another family doesn\'t have to send their kid away. So another father doesn\'t have to stand at the back of the ambulance and wonder if that\'s the last time you\'re going to see your son,\" Butrum told CNN., With the rise of Delta variant and the start of the new school year, CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen said this is the most dangerous time in the pandemic for children. , Experts have shared the best practices to keep families safe, but \"we as a society have failed our children,\" Wen said, citing the swathes of people navigating communities unmasked and unvaccinated and politicians disregarding the guidance. , \"As a result, we have made it harder for schools to stay open, we have made it more likely for children to be infected,\" Wen said. \"This is a really sad reflection that children are having to pay the price for irresponsible adults and reckless politicians.\" , Officials at odds over masking, Many health experts have pointed to mask mandates as a necessary step to getting the pandemic under control as officials work to boost vaccination rates, but some local leaders are increasingly at odds over such mandates. , Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton took the fight against mask mandates in his state to the Texas Supreme Court after various defeats in lower courts., The state Supreme Court ruled Sunday in favor of Paxton and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, temporarily blocking local mask mandates, but officials in Dallas and San Antonio said they would continue to enforce school mask mandates, despite the court ruling., Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis were the recipients of letters from the Department of Education in which Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said he is \"deeply concerned\" over mask mandate restrictions. , \"The Department recognizes that several school districts in your State have already moved to adopt such policies in line with guidance from the CDC for the reopening and operation of school facilities despite the State level prohibitions. The Department stands with these dedicated educators who are working to safely reopen schools and maintain safe in-person instruction,\" Cardona wrote in the letter to DeSantis, which was also addressed to Florida Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran., In May, DeSantis issued two executive orders limiting the Covid-19 restrictions counties and cities could impose, including mask mandates, and has since threatened punitive measures should a county or city defy them. , In an email to CNN on Sunday, a spokesperson for DeSantis reiterated the governor\'s position that his ban on school mask mandates is about empowering parents to make the best choice for their child and family., The Broward County School Board chair criticized DeSantis on Sunday over his position on school mask mandates. , \"We believe we have a constitutional obligation to protect the lives of our students and staff. And we\'ve received threats from our governor, and it\'s been really, really dramatic and horrible to be put in this position,\" Dr. Rosalind Osgood said on CBS\' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday. ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/16/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html',1,284),(209,'For unvaccinated people on the fence, work hurdles could change their minds','With the DeltaThe federal government -- the nation\'s largest employer -- will require unvaccinated employees to wear masks while working and get regular testing, and take other precautions, like maintaining physical distance from coworkers and restricting work travel. Several states, including Hawaii, California, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, also say unvaccinated state workers must get regular tests., California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday broadly extended such a mandate to teachers and all school employees, the first state to do so., Those programs, with their testing alternative, differ from outright mandates to get vaccinated -- as some health care organizations including the health care workforce of the Department of Health and Human Services, hospitals and the US military are requiring., Employers, fearing a backlash, frame the policy as a choice, with both sides of the equation seen as effective in reducing the spread of Covid-19. Do public health experts think this approach will help?, All agreed the best solution is universal vaccination. Short of that, many said the moves by employers will add a layer of protection -- although how much remains to be seen. , Test results are \"really only a snapshot in time,\" said Dr. Gigi Kwik Gronvall, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Even testing every day, as was the standard in the Trump White House -- without other measures like masking -- didn\'t prevent staffers from falling ill last fall., And daily testing is cumbersome and costly., Employers hope the hassles required to remain unvaccinated in the workplace will encourage the reluctant to just get a vaccine. \"It\'s a forceful nudge,\" said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association., But there are challenges, too. Here\'s what several experts had to say:, Universal vaccination remains the gold standard, Getting all eligible people vaccinated is \"the perfect way out of this whole situation,\" said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers. \"But, given the realities of the current situation, I think it\'s reasonable that employers and others who are setting up vaccine requirements offer some accommodations.\", But much depends, he and others said, on how well the rules are enforced., \"If (unvaccinated) people are wearing masks all day at work, even in the break room, that alone is pretty strong,\" he said. \"When you add in the testing, it\'s an alternative that is going to have some value.\", Some employers, he noted, are reluctant to set such edicts because they fear losing employees, particularly in areas already suffering shortages, such as nursing homes., This approach relies somewhat on the honor system, Some states, health care organizations and New York City say they\'ll require proof of vaccination -- a copy of an employee\'s vaccination certificate or a version uploaded into an app on a person\'s phone. But other employers say they will allow workers to self-attest that they\'ve had the vaccine., \"There will be some folks who fib, no doubt about that,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville., \"That will raise the issue of annoyance and concern by the vaccinated people,\" Schaffner said. \"They will say, \'Wait a minute, Charlie is here and he\'s not wearing a mask and we know he\'s not vaccinated.\' People know that sort of stuff about their coworkers.\", There are other consequences., There is online traffic in buying forged vaccination cards, designed to look like the real thing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- even though that is illegal and can lead to fines or even jail time, the FBI has warned. Employers could also take disciplinary action against workers who falsely state they\'ve been vaccinated., As for test results, it\'s less clear how the honor system will apply. Some workers -- especially those in health care organizations -- may well be able to get their tests done in-house. Other companies may allow workers to find (and pay for) outside testing. It isn\'t known whether employers will allow the use of self-administered home tests. And what kind of test companies require matters, since the rapid antigen tests are not as reliable as the standard PCR versions. To complicate matters, rising demand for tests during the surge has led to long lines for both kinds of tests in some parts of the country, and results for the more accurate PCR version may take days., Frequency of testing will vary and may not be ideal, Many of the workplace edicts -- including the one for federal workers -- call for weekly or twice-a-week testing. Is that enough? It\'s hard to give an exact answer., Dr. Robert Wachter, professor and chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, prefers tests be performed twice a week, especially given the explosion of cases in many parts of the country., \"If you\'re only testing once a week, there will be some cases that slip through,\" Wachter said. \"You could get tested on a Monday, infected on Tuesday and could infect someone else that Friday or Saturday.\", Who\'s paying?, While some employers may pick up the cost, at least initially, not all will. And workers should not count on testing being fully covered by their health insurers, either. They may well have to pay out-of-pocket for employer-required tests., \"Generally, health insurance providers are covering covid tests that are taken for diagnosing or treating a patient -- if they are displaying symptoms or have had contact with someone who has been diagnosed with covid,\" said Kristine Grow, a spokesperson for AHIP (America\'s Health Insurance Plans), the industry\'s lobbying group. , But, she noted, guidance issued last year by several federal agencies said that testing \"conducted to screen for general workplace health and safety, for public health surveillance, or for any other purpose not primarily intended for diagnosis or treatment\" does not have to be covered by insurers., Bottom line: Employees could have to go through a lot of hoops to remain unvaccinated in the workplace. \"That will get old very quickly for a lot of people,\" Schaffner said. \"That will push a lot of people off the fence and onto the vaccination side.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/17/health/unvaccinated-workers-covid-partner-khn-wellness/index.html',1,285),(210,'Covid-19 hospitalizations are surging again, but they\'re different this time','Covid-19 hospitalizations in the United States have been growing for more than a month, and at the current pace -- more than 2,500 patients added each day over the past week, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services -- the US will surpass January\'s record high in about a month.

And with vaccines widely available, they\'re mostly preventable, too., Mercy Hospital in Joplin, Missouri, has surpassed its record number of Covid-19 patients more than once in the past two weeks, according to hospital president Jeremy Drinkwitz. , Things are very different from last time, he says. , \"As far as the very distinct differences -- the age of patients for us,\" Drinkwitz told CNN. The hospital recently had three patients between 30 and 40, multiple patients in their 40s and some in their 50s and 60s on ventilators, he said. , \"In November, when we had our first big spike, we didn\'t,\" Drinkwitz said. \"We didn\'t have that younger population; it was more of the elderly population.\", Now, he said, there are fewer elderly patients. \"We\'re just not seeing that many. We have a few, but it\'s not anywhere close to the younger population,\" Drinkwitz said., Seniors still have the highest per capita rate of hospitalizations, but the gap is smaller than it\'s been. , The recent hospitalization rate among seniors age 70 and older is about a quarter of what it was in January, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But hospitalization rates among younger adults are about as high as they were in January. , In fact, the hospitalization rate among adults age 30 to 39 is the highest it\'s ever been, CDC data shows. , Children also account for a larger share of hospitalizations now than they did in January, as hospitalization rates among those under the age of 18 hover right around the record high., In a few states -- including Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina and Louisiana -- the number of children hospitalized with Covid-19 more than doubled over the past week, federal data shows. , But with every 12 and older eligible to be vaccinated against Covid-19, experts have different concerns about this new wave of hospitalizations., , Early in the pandemic, there weren\'t enough tools to care for patients and doctors didn\'t know if what they were doing for their patients was the right thing, Dr. O\'Neil Pyke, chief medical officer of Jackson North Medical Center, Jackson Health System in Florida, told CNN. As a critical care and internal medicine doctor, he cared for patients himself during the early stages of the pandemic, from March to October of last year. , \"Now, my biggest concern is that we have a very, very good tool, right, we have the vaccine, and the vaccine has been proven now to be remarkably efficacious as it pertains to preventing severe illness and death,\" he said. \"It doesn\'t necessarily prevent getting the virus, but it certainly does prevent severe illness requiring hospitalization and death. And the concern is that the community still has that hesitancy.\"  , While Pyke said he understands this hesitancy to a degree, the best way to look at it is as though the vaccine is a dam., \"We have this deluge of flooding going on, and what we\'re doing in terms of trying with the medicines that we\'re trying over the months is basically scooping out cups of water from this flood,\" he said. \"But the vaccine is like a dam, and the vaccine can do so much more in preventing the flooding that we\'re seeing right now. And that\'s the very essence of it.\" , Florida has the highest hospitalization rate in the country, according to the latest data from HHS. More than 65 people are hospitalized with Covid-19 for every 100,000 people in Florida, about one out of every 1,500 state residents. That\'s more than triple the national rate. , Every state with a higher than average hospitalization rate has a lower than average vaccination rate, including Florida, according to a CNN analysis of data from the CDC and HHS., And it\'s taking a toll on a health care system that has been operating at full strength for a year and a half, Pyke says. , \"We thought we turned the corner a bit on this, and here we are going back up,\" he said. \"Obviously whatever we are feeling pales in comparison to what patients are feeling and their families, but it\'s overwhelming to the staff to be caring for patients with the same disease we thought we just, we might be seeing the end of.\" , In Arkansas, the Covid-19 hospitalization rate is more than double the national rate and the fifth highest in the country. Hospitalization rates among children are higher than they\'ve ever been in the state. But so, too, are hospitalization rates among young adults under 30, who have been eligible to be vaccinated for months. , Dr. Stephen Mette, CEO of UAMS Health in Arkansas, said that low vaccination rate is the \"first and foremost\" contributing factor to the latest increase in hospitalizations., Like Mercy Hospital in Joplin, UAMS has recently surpassed its record high number of hospitalizations in the pandemic. The majority of patients hospitalized with Covid at UAMS are either not vaccinated at all or not fully vaccinated, Mette said. And vaccinated patients have, so far, had a significant underlying medical condition. , \"We knew we would have another wave, but we were maybe lulled into that false sense of security that we would have a large enough number of Americans, or Arkansans, vaccinated so that we would not have a very high wave,\" Mette said. \"So, we were prepared, but not for this degree of the manifestation of this wave.\" , Other major contributing factors, Mette said, include different characteristics of the Delta variant, the relaxation of public health measures and the public\'s general pandemic fatigue., Vaccination rates in the US have ticked up over recent weeks, a trend that experts say needs to continue to curb the current surge of Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. , \"We love our community, we love our neighbors and our friends here and our community, and we\'re here to serve them, and because of that we\'re fighting like hell to save their lives. Thirty year olds and 40 year olds should have a chance to live a full life and so we\'re trying to do everything we can to help them after they have gotten this virus,\" Drinkwitz said. , But the medical professionals need the help of the community. , \"I\'m asking people actually to open their eyes and realize what\'s happening. That there are hospitals and healthcare is being challenged, there\'s capacity issues in communities, and that we have to do something,\" Drinkwitz said. \"We need help on the other side. We need people to be vaccinated. And if they just can\'t get their minds wrapped around that, then please wear a mask, social distance, those things we know to do.\" ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/13/health/covid-hospitalizations-younger-not-vaccinated/index.html',1,286),(211,'US could soon hit more than 200,000 new coronavirus cases per day, NIH director warns','The US could soon see more than 200,000 new cases of Covid-19 every day as the Delta variant spreads at a rapid pace, particularly among unvaccinated people, the director of the National Institutes of Health predicted.\"I will be surprised if we don\'t cross 200,000 cases a day in the next couple of weeks, and that\'s heartbreaking considering we never thought we would be back in that space again,\" Dr. Francis Collins said on Fox News Sunday., \"That was January, February, that shouldn\'t be August. But here we are with the Delta variant, which is so contagious, and this heartbreaking situation where 90 million people are still unvaccinated, who are sitting ducks for this virus, and that\'s the mess we\'re in.\", That mark is still a ways off. As of Saturday, the US has averaged about 129,000 daily new cases over the last 7 days, a number that has risen every day since July 5, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The country last averaged over 200,000 cases per day in January, before the Covid-19 vaccines were widely available., Then as now, the alarming uptick has stretched health resources thin as many hospitals struggle to meet the demand of those who need crucial medical care., \"The system is breaking,\" CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner told CNN\'s Jim Acosta on Saturday., \"It\'s not just the beds. Many hospitals can find beds in places like parking structures or cafeterias. But it\'s qualified people to staff those beds. And the United States is critically short on ICU nurses, so finding the qualified staff to take care of critically ill patients becomes increasingly hard,\" said Reiner, a professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University., Because older people have much higher vaccination rates -- over 90% of people 65 and older have had at least one shot -- this surge has particularly hit younger populations., The rate of new hospitalizations among people in their 30s increased by nearly 300% over the past month, according to an analysis of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. New Covid-19 hospital admissions among people in their 30s are now the highest since the pandemic began, according to the data., Health experts say the solution is to vaccinate as many people as possible, because the vaccines provide good protection against severe disease. As of Sunday, 50.7% of the US population was fully vaccinated. That\'s 59.3% of those eligible to receive a vaccination, CDC data shows., \"We are going to have to continue to get people vaccinated so that right now, even in states in which you have a good relative proportion of people vaccinated, you have to get the overwhelming proportion of people vaccinating,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CBS\' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday., Extra vaccine shot for the immune-compromised, and possibly others, More vaccine shots will also be available for some already-vaccinated people., The US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday authorized an additional vaccine dose to be administered to people with compromised immune systems, who may not have an adequate immune response to the vaccine., Vaccine advisers to the CDC voted unanimously to recommend the additional dose for some immunocompromised people on Friday. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky quickly endorsed the vote, which means people can get these third doses right away., Booster shots may also be made available for others soon, such as elderly people, those in nursing homes or even the general population. Some officials are concerned that the Delta variant may be able to evade some of the vaccine\'s protection., \"There is a concern that the vaccine may start to wane in its effectiveness over months, and Delta is a nasty one for us to try to deal with,\" Collins said. \"The combination of those two means we may need boosters, maybe beginning first with health care providers, as well as people in nursing homes and then gradually moving forward.\" , Fauci said the vaccines still provide strong protection, but officials are studying the issue to determine if such boosters are needed., \"So if it turns out, as the data come in, we see we do need to give an additional dose to people in nursing homes, actually, or people who are elderly, we will be absolutely prepared to do that very quickly,\" Fauci said., How you wear your mask matters, experts say, As mask mandates in schools become a contentious topic in districts across the South, experts want Americans to know the safest way students should mask up. , CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen said returning to schools safely is possible. , \"Quality of masks really matters,\" she told CNN\'s Pamela Brown Saturday. \"Don\'t send your child to school with a cloth face covering. Use as least a three-ply surgical mask and, ideally, an N95 or KN95 if your child is old enough and can tolerate it.\" , Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, echoed that sentiment. , \"Mask with the most highly efficient and effective means you have. These are the N95 masks,\" he told CNN. , He added that while the US had a supply shortage of those masks during the pandemic\'s onset, there\'s now an abundance of them. , \"Use them. And when you use them, please don\'t wear them under your nose ... That\'s nothing more than a chin diaper. And it doesn\'t provide you any protection,\" he said. , Osterholm said Covid-19 is largely transmitted by aerosols, which are tiny particles in the air. He explained that if you can smell the smoke of a cigarette from 20 feet way while masked, then you need a higher quality mask for optimal safety. ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/15/health/us-coronavirus-sunday/index.html',1,290),(212,'A third dose of Covid-19 vaccine is now authorized for some. Here\'s what you need to know about boosters for all','Vaccine makers are preparing for a next possible phase of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout: booster doses.The US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday authorized third doses of both the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna coronavirus vaccines for certain immunocompromised people: solid organ transplant recipients or \"those who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise.\" , The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has signed off on the authorization and now recommends an additional dose of vaccine for these certain people., But these doses will be considered part of the initial vaccination series for people who have not mounted an adequate immune response. A booster dose is something different. It helps refresh a waning immune response, or helps the body fight an evolving pathogen., The companies Pfizer and BioNTech said Monday they have submitted data from a Phase 1 study to the FDA supporting the use of a third, or booster, dose of their Covid-19 vaccine. The data showed that the booster dose elicited a significantly higher antibody response against the initial strain of the coronavirus, as well as against the Delta and Beta variants, compared to what was seen among people who got two doses., \"The data we\'ve seen to date suggest a third dose of our vaccine elicits antibody levels that significantly exceed those seen after the two-dose primary schedule. We are pleased to submit these data to the FDA as we continue working together to address the evolving challenges of this pandemic,\" Albert Bourla, Pfizer\'s chairman and chief executive officer, said in the announcement., And many Americans who aren\'t now eligible for an additional shot are wondering when it will be their turn., Who is eligible for an additional shot now? , The CDC said immunocompromised people are more likely to get breakthrough infections than people with healthy immune systems, and the recommendation on Friday allows certain immunocompromised people to get a third dose of Covid-19 vaccine., \"This EUA is intended to be for people with moderate to severe immunosuppression and not persons with chronic conditions for which there might be mild associated immunosuppression,\" the CDC\'s Dr. Amanda Cohn told the meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. , The third doses were recommended for immunocompromised people as young as 12, who are included in Pfizer\'s EUA. People as young as 18 can get a third dose of Moderna\'s vaccine. The CDC urges people to get the same vaccine they got originally. , There\'s not enough data to discuss the possibility of an extra dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s one-shot Covid-19 vaccine, the FDA said., The CDC said patients and doctors should decide who needs an extra dose and what the timing of that dose should be. No prescription or doctor\'s note will be needed --  people must attest to their need for the third dose -- and third doses are already available at major pharmacies and doctors\' offices., What about boosters for everyone?, Covid-19 vaccine boosters are not currently needed for the general US population, but the administration is checking the data daily and will be ready if that changes, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Thursday., \"We\'re trying to understand if there\'s a decrease in protection that\'s manifesting as a significant increase in breakthrough infections, particularly breakthrough hospitalizations and deaths,\" Murthy told CNN\'s Erin Burnett., Murthy said the administration is looking at data from pharmaceutical companies, private health care systems and other countries, including the UK, Israel and Canada., \"We look at that data very regularly, closely. When we see the threshold met, that\'s when we\'ll recommend boosters for additional people,\" Murthy said. \"That\'s an if question. It\'s a when question, and the data is going to drive our decision on that.\", , However, the Biden administration is expected to lay out a Covid-19 vaccine booster strategy for all vaccinated Americans in September -- with possible details on a phased rollout, starting with the most vulnerable., National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins acknowledged on Fox News Sunday that boosters may be needed \"maybe beginning first with health care providers, as well as people in nursing homes and then gradually moving forward.\", The US can look to Covid-19 vaccination in Israel for an idea of what may need to be considered a month or so in the future, Andy Slavitt, former White House Covid-19 adviser, said Thursday. Israel has authorized Covid-19 vaccine booster doses for adults older than 50, becoming one of the first countries in the world to make such a move., \"Israel began their vaccination process a little bit ahead of us, so I think in many respects, we\'ve been looking to them -- and to a certain extent, the UK -- for what we can expect, as well as the people who participated in the original clinical trials of the vaccines in 2020,\" Slavitt told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper on Thursday. \"Those three things together, generally speaking, give us a sense of what to predict for the future.\", , Some researchers and health officials suspect antibodies against coronavirus produced through the vaccines may diminish over time -- possibly after a year or more -- and may not protect as well against coronavirus variants that could emerge. , In July, Israel\'s health ministry said in a statement that it had seen efficacy of Pfizer\'s vaccine drop from more than 90% to about 64% as the B.1.617.2 or Delta variant spread., That might mean a vaccinated person would need a booster dose of vaccine to stay protected against the original coronavirus strain and newly emerging variants -- including the Delta variant -- in a way similar to how a tetanus booster is recommended every 10 years or different flu vaccines are recommended each year., , In the case of Covid-19 vaccines, it remains unknown for how long immune protection lasts, but vaccine developers and health officials know it may not be forever -- and that emerging variants could evade immunity., \"There is a little nuance with Covid-19 vaccines,\" Dr. William Moss, professor and executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told CNN in May. , While typical booster doses use the same vaccine formula someone previously received to remind the immune system about immunity to a pathogen, Moss said, any future boosters for the Covid-19 shot could use altered vaccine formulas. , For instance, the companies Pfizer and BioNTech said in a statement that while a third dose of their coronavirus vaccine \"has the potential to preserve the highest levels of protective efficacy against all currently tested variants including Delta, the companies are remaining vigilant and are developing an updated version of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that targets the full spike protein of the Delta variant.\", What happens if you skip the booster?, Whether booster coronavirus vaccine doses are modified or not, missing a booster dose -- if one is recommended in the future -- could leave someone less protected against Covid-19., , \"A person who skipped a booster is placing themselves at higher risk of getting infected, and getting disease from the SARS-Coronavirus-2, but I would also expect that they\'re going to have some partial immunity and so they may be protected against more severe disease,\" Moss said in May. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes Covid-19., \"They\'re just at higher risk of infection and disease than someone who got the booster, but they have more immunity than someone who was never vaccinated.\", Scientists are also currently investigating whether it makes a difference if someone gets the same type of vaccine as a booster as the original dose administered., , Then there is the question of mixing and matching doses. , Researchers in the United Kingdom reported in May that people who got mixed doses of coronavirus vaccines -- receiving a different vaccine type as a second dose than the first dose -- appear to be more likely to experience mild side effects such as fever, chills, fatigue or headache., But the side effects following mix-and-match vaccinations were short-lived and there were no other safety concerns, the researchers reported in the Lancet medical journal., Who is making booster shots?, All three companies that currently have authorized coronavirus vaccines in the United States -- Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson -- are investigating the potential use of boosters. , \"The data that I see coming, they are supporting the notion that likely there will be a need for a booster somewhere between eight and 12 months,\" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told Axios in May. \"But that remains to be seen and I believe in one, two months we will have enough data to speak about it with much higher scientific certainty.\", The first dose of Pfizer\'s coronavirus vaccine in the United States was administered on December 14, 2020., , Moderna is currently conducting booster shot trials too., The fight against the coronavirus pandemic is expected to continue through next year due to the emergence of variants, Dr. Stephen Hoge, president of Moderna, said during an earnings call in early May., \"We think this is just the beginning,\" Hoge said. \"Therefore, we\'re committed as a company to make as many updates to the vaccine, to add as many variants as we think are necessary, to ensure that when people receive a booster, it provides the broadest immune protection against the widest range of variants.\", Johnson &amp; Johnson is also looking into the potential for boosters, the company told CNN., Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s coronavirus vaccine, along with Pfizer\'s, Moderna\'s, and four others, are being tested as seasonal boosters in a study called Cov-Boost being conducted by the UK\'s National Institute for Health Research and the University of Southampton., The biotechnology company Novavax has developed a coronavirus vaccine that its chief executive officer Stanley Erck believes could be used as a booster shot for people who have already been vaccinated. The company plans to apply for emergency use authorization of its vaccine in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2021., Who has to OK the Covid-19 booster shots?, The decision to broadly use Covid-19 boosters is expected to involve two agencies -- the FDA and the CDC -- and the regulatory process to get the shots into arms could vary depending on whether the booster is the same vaccine that was originally used or is a modified version., \"So, if it\'s the same vaccine, my understanding is that what would have to happen is that the CDC would have to recommend an additional dose with details around when that should occur,\" Moss said in May., In other words, the FDA must give authorization for the vaccines to be used in new ways outside the existing authorization. Then, the CDC advises on whether to actually use the vaccine as authorized by the FDA., , If it\'s a modified vaccine, \"this is where things get interesting and I don\'t think we quite know,\" Moss said, but added that the regulatory process could be similar to what happens with flu vaccines each year. , \"Technically, whenever a vaccine like that is modified, it\'s often considered a new vaccine and has to go through the whole process again. But there is a precedent, obviously, with influenza virus vaccines, not to do that,\" Moss said. \"So, the influenza vaccine each year doesn\'t have to go through a large Phase 3 trial.\", That\'s because the vaccine technology stays the same, and the only change is the strain of flu virus that the vaccine targets., How is it determined that someone needs a booster?, There is no definite way to know someone needs an additional dose of coronavirus vaccine -- but so far, studies on booster doses have measured antibody levels., Cancer patients who receive the Covid-19 vaccine, for example, are less likely to develop protective antibodies, according to two studies published this week in the journal JAMA Oncology. Antibodies are proteins the body makes to fight infection., , Yet the researchers noted that the test used to detect Covid-19 antibodies does not provide information about T-cell-based immunity or clinical outcomes related to potential Covid-19 infection. T-cells and B-cells are other components of the immune system with immune memory that can protect the body against infection., In one of those studies, researchers in Israel followed up on initial findings showing anti-spike Covid-19 antibody levels were significantly lower among cancer patients 5.5 weeks after the second dose of an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, compared to non-cancer patients., The team looked at 95 cancer patients and 66 control patients from their initial analysis about four months after their second vaccine dose. About 87% of cancer patients and 100% of patients in the control group showed anti-spike antibodies, and antibody levels were still significantly lower in the cancer patients. The researchers noted that the median antibody level for both groups decreased over time., , Separately, among organ transplant recipient patients in a Johns Hopkins University study who had no measurable antibodies after receiving two doses of vaccine, one-third of them saw a rise in antibodies after a third dose -- and among those with low antibody levels after two doses, all of them saw an increase after a third dose. , Dr. Dorry Segev, an author of the study and founder of the Epidemiology Research Group in Organ Transplantation at Johns Hopkins University, told CNN in June that it\'s unclear what antibody level provides protective immunity. \"We don\'t know if you need the same off-the-charts level of antibodies that people with normal immune systems have,\" he said., How often will you need a Covid-19 booster?, Some experts predict that a coronavirus vaccine booster dose might be needed annually -- but despite such predictions, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said that the bottom line is no one knows yet., Still, the US is prepared for the possibility, Fauci said during a White House Covid-19 Response Team briefing in August., , Fauci said he believes eventually everyone will need a booster to maintain full protection from the vaccine.  , \"We are evaluating this on a day by day, week by week, month by month basis, looking at any of a number of studies, both international and domestic.\" he said., He added that if it looks like immunity is waning, or a variant is evading the protection offered by current vaccines, then health officials will be ready to recommend boosters., , Eventually, it\'s possible that a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine might just be part of the completion of immunization, not an annual requirement to revaccinate, Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA\'s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said last week., \"I don\'t think that we want to think that these vaccines have somehow failed us,\" Marks said at a discussion hosted by the Covid-19 Vaccine Education and Equity Project., \"It may simply be that to get the kind of really good immunity against Covid-19 that we get with some other vaccines, it may take a series of three vaccinations, much the same way that hepatitis B for adults and multiple childhood vaccination primary series, you need to get a vaccination, you know, 0, 1; or 0, 2 and 4; or 0, 2 and 6 months.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/14/health/covid-19-vaccine-boosters-explainer-fda-wellness/index.html',1,291),(213,'More than a year later, America grapples with long Covid','\"I was told to go home and rest, that everything would be fine in two weeks. Sadly, those two weeks for me have never come,\" said Chimére Smith, 39, one of many Americans fighting long Covid.According to multiple studies, long Covid may affect up to a third of Covid-19 patients. Smith is one of them, and people like her continue to feel the effects of the disease months, weeks, or, in Smith\'s case, more than a year after an acute infection.  , A study out of Stanford University reported that the most common persistent symptoms after Covid-19 were fatigue and trouble breathing, which impacted people\'s ability to work and do other activities. Participants in that study also reported memory problems, loss of taste and smell, and even hair loss. , \'I was dismissed\', In late March of 2020, Smith, a school teacher from Baltimore, Maryland, went to her primary care doctor with a sore throat, shortness of breath, dizziness, diarrhea, and difficulty standing up -- some of the symptoms that are now recognized by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as possible symptoms of Covid-19. In her first month of illness, her symptoms went from dizziness to fainting and to feeling like \"someone had hit my head on the concrete.\" , But, Smith says, \"I was dismissed. I was accused of being anxious and paranoid.\", , Meanwhile, her condition continued to deteriorate, as going into the second month of her illness, she reported more problems with vision, breathing, as well as neurological symptoms like memory problems. By month six, she was unable to walk., Smith, who identifies as a Black woman, said when she went to see doctors -- many of them White men -- they assumed she was a drug addict. One accused her of being \"too aggressive\" when she tried to contest their assumptions about what was ailing her. , \"There\'s nothing worse than being told that when vision is lost in your left eye, that it is a dry eye,\" Smith said. , She ended up taking more than a dozen Covid-19 tests, all of which turned out negative. Antibody tests were negative too. But, according to Dr. Igor Koralnik, chief of neuroinfectious diseases and global neurology at Northwestern University, it\'s not unexpected that long-haulers test negative for viral particles and antibodies. By the time long-haul symptoms establish themselves, patients may no longer be shedding viral particles, and antibodies in the blood can diminish quickly. (A small study from China found that even patients who were hospitalized sometimes tested negative.), , It\'s unclear just how many Black women are also struggling with long Covid, but Smith says she has received an influx of messages from Black women like her who are also suffering from symptoms associated with long Covid, while struggling to get the care they need. According to the CDC,  compared to White people, Black people have a slightly higher risk of developing Covid-19, and almost three times the risk of being hospitalized for it., Smith has seen her plans to become a school principal evaporate, along with her plans to help her mother retire and to help her family after her niece\'s birth. \"People don\'t understand what happens in a Black community when a Black woman loses a job or is unable to function,\" she said., Smith\'s activism work with Body Politic, a wellness and advocacy collective that provides support to long Covid patients, has gained attention from the National Institutes of Health and the CDC. Her input with Body Politic has made it into the CDC guidance for caring for Covid patients, which \"felt like an Olympic torch... Because I am so proud of the work that we\'ve been able to do.\",  , Body Politic has given Smith a community of people with similar experiences that can organize and support each other through long Covid\'s mysterious struggles. Smith herself has become a spokesperson and advocate for patients like her; she has testified before Congress about long Covid\'s effects on people and their communities. , And patients are just starting to get the recognition they need to, she hopes, get better. On July 26th, the Biden Administration released guidance that stated long Covid could qualify as a disability under federal law, and would thus be covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act. , , Smith told CNN that her ability to walk is starting to come back, and while she still considers herself disabled, she has made progress in recovering. , But the mystery of long Covid persists. , How does a respiratory disease end up affecting the brain?, A year and a half into the pandemic, experts still puzzle over the how a respiratory virus may result in \"brain fog\" and memory problems. , \"Long Covid\'s effects on the brain are probably multifactorial,\" says Dr. Dennis Kolson, a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania who is studying Covid-19\'s long-term impacts on the brain. He said that there\'s \"very limited\" evidence that the virus that causes Covid-19 is actually infecting the brain tissue. Rather, many of the neurological issues doctors are seeing are probably due to infection throughout the body., Experts have proposed a number of theories that could explain long-term neurological effects of Covid-19. It could be that the lungs aren\'t able to get enough oxygen to the brain or that the immune system causes so much damage throughout the body that the brain is also affected. , A preprint of a study in April found evidence that the virus interferes with cells in tiny blood vessels called capillaries, which would affect blood flow to the brain. , It is also possible that some virus particles themselves are causing damage in the brain, though according to Kolson, it is unlikely that this explains the long-term effects patients are seeing. , , However, importantly, it\'s very unlikely there\'s only one right answer. \"Different mechanisms may lead to similar neurologic outcomes,\" Kolson said. , Doctors investigate treatment options, Dr. Michael Saag is an infectious disease doctor in Alabama who treats Covid-19 patients and has been living with long Covid himself. His initial illness involved chills, fever, muscle and body aches, a loss of smell and taste, \"brain fog,\" and a grueling, nightly cycle of frightening drops in oxygen levels he likened to the movie \"Groundhog Day.\" , Saag managed to avoid hospitalization. But, after his initial symptoms cleared up, he found out that he wasn\'t quite done with the virus. He would find himself unable to focus or think clearly each day after 2 p.m. He said his \"sense of hearing, which was starting to become a little bit impaired before Covid, took a pretty big hit.\" While he has recovered some of his sense of hearing, he now uses a hearing aid., In the early stages of the pandemic, the care he was able to provide for his patients living with long Covid was limited. \"So going March to April-May, we didn\'t know anything about long Covid... And as a provider, when we all went through this, we didn\'t have much to offer except hand-holding and comfort care,\" Saag said., , However, he sees some hope on the horizon. \"The fact that so many people at one time over the course of a year have developed this long-haul syndrome, that gives us a chance, an opportunity to study it intensively, and that\'s what\'s going on right now,\" he said., One of those hopes might be the Penn Neuro Covid-19 Care Clinic, where Kolson is a provider. It\'s one of a number of centers that have formed to care for patients with a range of symptoms after Covid-19, including Northwestern\'s Comprehensive COVID-19 Center and the Johns Hopkins Post-Acute COVID-19 Team. , The Penn Neuro Clinic uses a \"comprehensive type of approach,\" according to Kolson, where patients are given a full neurologic examination but are also put in touch with experts from other departments in the Penn system, such as the cardiology department, because of how Covid-19 tends to affect multiple organ systems. The Northwestern clinic, Koralnik noted, does not ask for physician referral, and accepts telemedicine requests from around the country. , More concentrated studies to understand long Covid are also underway. Koralnik said that the Northwestern clinic is researching the effects of long Covid on cognition, sleep, and its ophthalmologic impacts. The National Institutes of Health has launched its Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or PASC initiative. The initiative coordinates and funds a number of studies to understand the effects of long Covid and how they might be treated. Some sites have already enrolled tens of thousands of people to investigate the condition and its causes. , For patients like Smith, the recent initiatives are good, but she\'s stressed the need for Black women like her to be included. In one study aiming to characterize the lingering symptoms of long Covid from the University of Washington, just 1.7% of the 177 participants were Black. In a study aiming to evaluate risk factors for long Covid with more than 43,000 participants out of Columbia University, just 22% of its participants are Black. , \"We desperately need the government and policy makers and doctors to step in to include us in research, to write and to capture adequate notes about our circumstances and our conditions and to believe us when we tell the doctors that we suspect that we have cases of Covid,\" she said., But there\'s more work to be done. \"I just hope that...

And the seven-day average has topped more than 135,000 cases, well ahead of other nations., On a state-by-state comparison, Louisiana has the highest rate of new cases per capita, followed by Florida., \"That\'s how badly things have gotten out of hand. There is a screaming level of transmission across the southern states right now.

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky quickly endorsed the vote, which means people can begin getting third doses right away., On Friday, Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said it\'s important not to confuse that third dose with a \"booster\" shot., \"These are really about finishing a primary series. Think about childhood immunizations. We have vaccines for which we need three or four doses. What we found here is that the immune-compromised often didn\'t mount an adequate response at all.

Of the new cases, 98% of those are in unvaccinated people, the state\'s dashboard shows., A shortage of health care workers, Gov. Tate Reeves said a shortage of health care workers is exacerbating the strain on hospitals, saying the state lost 2,000 health care workers last year., He said a call has gone out to out-of-state workers -- 73 hospitals have requested 65 physicians, 920 nurses, 41 CRNAs, 59 advanced practice nurses, 34 physician assistants, 239 respiratory technicians and 20 EMT paramedics., In Florida, Brevard County officials issued an urgent plea this week for residents to try to avoid using ambulance services for nonemergency calls or going to hospitals for Covid-19 tests. , First responders and departments are feeling the effects of the Delta coronavirus variant surge throughout the country. , In Memphis, Tennessee, emergency departments are overworked due to the pandemic, with August having the potential to be the busiest month in the history of the city\'s fire department, Fire Chief Gina Sweat said., Due to constraints \"on all levels\" of bed capacity, Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville is limiting elective cases and declining transfer requests from many other facilities, officials said while announcing the hospital and emergency department are \"completely full.\", And Chief Medical Officer Dr. Geoff Lifferth at Sumner Regional Medical Center in Gallatin, Tennessee, said the hospital had no more open beds. \"As an ER doc and a healthcare administrator, this past week has been one of the most exhausting and disheartening of my career,\" he said in an emotional Facebook post., In Texas, the Department of State Health Services said a shortage of pediatric ICU beds in Dallas County is related to a shortage in medical personnel. , \"Hospitals are licensed for a specific number of beds and most hospitals regularly staff fewer beds than they are licensed for. They can\'t use beds that aren\'t staffed. With the increase in COVID cases, hospitals are experiencing a shortage of people to staff the beds that they are licensed for,\" health department spokesperson Lara Anton said. , Gov.

','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/13/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html',1,295),(216,'This is why we can\'t remember our early childhood memories','Most of us don\'t have any memories from the first three to four years of our lives -- in fact, we tend to remember very little of life before the age of 7. And when we do try to think back to our earliest memories, it is often unclear whether they are the real thing or just recollections based on photos or stories told to us by others.The phenomenon, known as \"childhood amnesia,\" has been puzzling psychologists for more than a century -- and we still don\'t fully understand it., , At first glance, it may seem that the reason we don\'t remember being babies is because infants and toddlers don\'t have a fully developed memory. But babies as young as six months can form both short-term memories that last for minutes and long-term memories that last weeks, if not months. , In one study, six-month-olds who learned how to press a lever to operate a toy train remembered how to perform this action for two to three weeks after they had last seen the toy. Preschoolers, on the other hand, can remember events that go years back. It\'s debatable whether long-term memories at this early age are truly autobiographical, though -- that is, personally relevant events that occurred in a specific time and place., READ MORE: How parents can help kids deal with back-to-school anxiety, Of course, memory capabilities at these ages are not adult-like -- they continue to mature until adolescence. In fact, developmental changes in basic memory processes have been put forward as an explanation for childhood amnesia, and it\'s one of the best theories we\'ve got so far. These basic processes involve several brain regions and include forming, maintaining and then later retrieving the memory. , The hippocampus, thought to be responsible for forming memories, continues developing until at least the age of seven. We know that the typical boundary for the offset of childhood amnesia -- three and a half years -- shifts with age. Children and teenagers have earlier memories than adults do. This suggests that the problem may be less with forming memories than with maintaining them., But this does not seem to be the whole story. Another factor that we know plays a role is language. From the ages of one to six, children progress from the one-word stage of speaking to becoming fluent in their native language(s), so there are major changes in their verbal ability that overlap with the childhood amnesia period. This includes using the past tense, memory-related words such as \"remember\" and \"forget\" and personal pronouns, a favorite being \"mine.\", READ MORE: Kids set free to roam on their own feel more confident navigating in adulthood , It is true to some extent that a child\'s ability to verbalize about an event at the time that it happened predicts how well they remember it months or years later. One lab group conducted this work by interviewing toddlers brought to accident and emergency departments for common childhood injuries. Toddlers over 26 months, who could verbalize about the event at the time, recalled it up to five years later, whereas those under 26 months, who could not talk about it, recalled little or nothing. This suggests that preverbal memories are lost if they are not translated into language., Social and cultural effects, However, most research on the role of language focuses on a particular form of expression called narrative, and its social function. When parents reminisce with very young children about past events, they implicitly teach them narrative skills -- what kinds of events are important to remember and how to structure talking about them in a way that others can understand., Unlike simply recounting information for factual purposes, reminiscing revolves around the social function of sharing experiences with others. In this way, family stories maintain the memory\'s accessibility over time, and also increase the coherence of the narrative, including the chronology of events, their theme, and their degree of emotion. More coherent stories are remembered better. Maori adults have the earliest childhood memories (age 2.5) of any society studied so far, thanks to Maori parents\' highly elaborative style of telling family stories., READ MORE: Teaching kids social responsibility reduces bullying, Reminiscing has different social functions in different cultures, which contribute to cultural variations in the quantity, quality and timing of early autobiographical memories. Adults in cultures that value autonomy (North America, Western Europe) tend to report earlier and more childhood memories than adults in cultures that value relatedness (Asia, Africa)., This is predicted by cultural differences in parental reminiscing style. In cultures that promote more autonomous self-concepts, parental reminiscing focuses more on children\'s individual experiences, preferences and feelings, and less on their relationships with others, social routines and behavioral standards. For example, an American child might remember getting a gold star in preschool whereas a Chinese child might remember the class learning a particular song at preschool., READ MORE: Benefits of parenting a newborn during COVID-19 lockdown, While there are still things we don\'t understand about childhood amnesia, researchers are making progress. For example, there are more prospective longitudinal studies that follow individuals from childhood into the future. This helps give accurate accounts of events, which is better than retrospectively asking teens or adults to remember past events which are not documented. Also, as neuroscience progresses, there will undoubtedly be more studies relating brain development to memory development. This should help us develop other measures of memory besides verbal reports., In the meantime, it\'s important to remember that, even if we can\'t explicitly remember specific events from when we were very young, their accumulation nevertheless leaves lasting traces that influence our behavior. The first few years of life are paradoxically forgettable and yet powerful in shaping the adults that we become.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/13/health/childhood-memories-partner-wellness/index.html',1,297),(217,'More children are being admitted to hospitals with Covid-19 as health systems struggle to deal with surge of new patients','More children are being hospitalized with The seven-day average number of children reported hospitalized with Covid-19 jumped almost 30% to a new peak of 239 in the week ending August 9.

No test is FDA-authorized for checking immune response after getting a Covid vaccine. , ACIP members discussed whether it would be safe to recommend giving a third dose of vaccine to immunocompromised children as young as 12 and decided to recommend including children 12 and over -- who are included in Pfizer\'s EUA -- in their recommendation. Moderna\'s vaccine is authorized for use in people 18 and older., \"This EUA is intended to be for people with moderate to severe immunosuppression and not persons with chronic conditions for which there might be mild associated immunosuppression,\" the CDC\'s Dr. Amanda Cohn told the meeting., , \"The intent of our clinical considerations is to allow for some flexibility for providers to assess their patients\' immunosuppression and individuals will need to kind of attest to their immunosuppression to get vaccine,\" Cohn added., \"But the intent of this is to limit this to individuals for which, are considered under the EUA to be moderate or severe and so, for example, would not include long-term care facility residents or persons with diabetes, persons with heart disease. Those types of chronic medical conditions are not the intent here.\", Some people have already jumped the gun -- more than a million, the CDC found. , So far, \"approximately, 140 million individuals completed a two-dose primary series of either Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine,\" Dr. Kathleen Dooling, of the CDC\'s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during the ACIP meeting. , \"Approximately 1.14 million people -- that\'s less than 1% -- received one or more additional Covid-19 vaccine doses.\" And about 1% of the 12 million people who got a single dose of the J&amp;J Janssen vaccine got a second dose of vaccine. , , A recent study by Johns Hopkins researchers found that vaccinated immunocompromised people are 485 times more likely to end up in the hospital or die from Covid-19 compared to the general population that is vaccinated., The CDC estimates about 7 million American adults -- 2.7% of the adult population -- are immunocompromised, either because of diseases they have or medications they take.,  Disproportionate numbers of vaccine breakthroughs -- when a fully vaccinated person gets infected anyway -- are among immunocompromised people, \"For breakthrough cases, there\'s a larger proportion of immunocompromised ones in comparison to vaccinated cases,\" the CDC\'s Dr. Heather Scobie told ACIP., Cohn told the meeting that vaccine effectiveness is about 59% to 72% in immunocompromised people, compared to 90% to 94% overall., \"Immunocompromised people are more likely to get severely ill from Covid-19. They are at higher risk for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection and shedding and viral evolution during the infection and treatment, particularly amongst hospitalized patients,\" Cohn said., \"They are more likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to household contacts,\" she added., \"Immunocompromised people are more likely to have breakthrough infection. In small studies of hospitalized breakthrough cases, 40 to 44% were deemed to be immunocompromised.\", It has been known for months that Covid-19 vaccines might not work well for this group. The hope was that vaccination rates overall would be so high so that the \"herd\" would protect them. But it didn\'t work out that way -- about a third of eligible people in the US have not received even one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine., While the vaccines protect well against severe disease, there are some breakthroughs. Out of 164 million people vaccinated, the CDC has counted 7,101 hospitalizations for Covid-19, with 1,507 deaths. That number is likely an undercount, the CDC says.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/13/health/immunocompromised-additional-vaccine-dose-acip/index.html',1,299),(219,'Florida reports record high number of new Covid-19 cases this week','Florida reported a new record number of Covid-19 cases Friday -- more over the past week than any other seven-day period during the pandemic.

But they have also added a new tool to their arsenal: excrement.That tool alerted researchers to about 85% of cases in dorms before they were diagnosed, according to a soon-to-be published study, said Rob Knight, a professor of pediatrics and computer science and engineering who helped create the campus\'s wastewater testing program., When covid is detected in sewage, students, staffers and faculty members are tested, which has allowed the school to identify and isolate infected individuals who aren\'t yet showing symptoms — potentially stopping outbreaks in their tracks., UC-San Diego\'s testing program is among hundreds of efforts around California and the nation to turn waste into valuable health data. From Fresno, California, to Portland, Maine, universities, communities and businesses are monitoring human excrement for signs of covid., Researchers have high hopes for this sludgy new data stream, which they say can alert public health officials to trends in infections and doesn\'t depend on individuals getting tested. And because people excrete virus in feces before they show symptoms, it can serve as an early warning system for outbreaks., The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds the practice so promising that it has created a federal database of wastewater samples, transforming raw data into valuable information for local health departments. The program is essentially creating a public health tool in real time, experts say, one that could have a range of uses beyond the current global pandemic, including tracking other infectious diseases and germs\' resistance to antibiotics., \"We think this can really provide valuable data, not just for covid, but for a lot of diseases,\" said Amy Kirby, a microbiologist leading the CDC effort., The virus that causes covid infects many types of cells in the body, including those in the respiratory tract and gut. The virus\'s genetic signature, viral RNA, makes its way into feces, and typically shows up in poop days before symptoms start., At UC-San Diego and other campuses, researchers take samples flowing from individual buildings, capturing such granular data that they can often deduce the number of infected people living or working there. But in most other settings, due to privacy concerns and resource constraints, testing is done on a much larger scale with the goal of tracking trends over time., Samples are drawn from wastewater, which is what comes out of our sewer pipes, or sludge, the solids that have settled out of the wastewater. They are typically extracted mechanically or by a human with a dipper on the end of a rod., When researchers in Davis, California, saw the viral load rise in several neighborhood sewage streams in July, they sent out text-message alerts and hung signs on the doors of 3,000 homes recommending that people get tested., Before the pandemic, testing sewage to identify and ward off illness in the U.S. was largely limited to academic use. Israel used it to stave off a polio outbreak in 2013, and some communities in the U.S. were sampling sewage before the pandemic to figure out what kinds of opioids people in their communities were using, a service offered by the company Biobot., But when covid hit the U.S. amid political chaos and a shortage of tests, local governments scrambled for any information they could get on the virus., In rural Lake County, California, health officials had identified a handful of cases by sending nurses out to look for infected people. They were sure there were more but couldn\'t get their hands on tests to prove it, so in spring 2020 they signed up for a free sewage testing program run by Biobot, which pivoted to covid testing as the pandemic took off and now is charging to test in K-12 schools, office buildings and nursing homes, in addition to local governments and universities, said Mariana Matus, CEO and co-founder of the company., The covid virus turned up in samples at four wastewater treatment facilities in Lake County., \"It is a way to just get more information because we can\'t do testing,\" Gary Pace, then the county\'s health officer, told KHN at the time., As sewage sampling took off around the world, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services began awarding grants in fall 2020 to local wastewater treatment plants. Biobot won a bid to run a second round of that program, currently underway through late August, testing the sewage of up to 30% of the U.S. population., At least 25 California wastewater treatment plants are participating in the program, and numerous others are getting money from the CDC, working with local universities or paying for their own testing. While such states as Ohio and Missouri have created public dashboards to show their data, California\'s efforts remain scattershot., The test data alone doesn\'t provide much value to health officials — it needs to be translated to be useful. Scientists are still learning how to read the data, a complicated process that involves understanding the relationships between how much virus people excrete, how many people are using a wastewater system and how much rainwater is running into the system, potentially diluting the sewage, among many other factors. Since using wastewater to track diseases was not widespread before the pandemic, there\'s been a steep and ongoing learning curve., Beleaguered public health officials have struggled to incorporate the new data into their already overwhelming workloads, but the CDC hopes it can address those issues with its new national system that tracks and translates wastewater data for local governments., Throughout 2020, Kirby, the CDC microbiologist, and engineer Mia Mattioli were a two-person wastewater team inside the agency\'s larger 7,000-person covid response. During that time, academic colleagues generously shared what they knew about wastewater epidemiology, Kirby said. By September 2020, the pair had launched the National Wastewater Surveillance System, which interprets sampling data for state and local governments. Today, they lead a team of six and have a permanent place in one of the CDC\'s departments., \"Every piece of this system had to be built largely from scratch,\" Kirby said. \"When I look at that, it really amazes me where we are now.\", In the months since the system debuted, it has been able to detect an uptick in cases anywhere from four to six days before diagnostic testing shows an increase, Kirby said., She hopes that by the end of next year the federal monitoring program will be used to check for a range of diseases, including E. coli, salmonella, norovirus and a deadly drug-resistant fungus called Candida auris, which has become a global threat and wreaked havoc in hospitals and nursing homes., The longer these programs are up and running, the more useful they become, said Colleen Naughton, a professor and civil engineer at the University of California-Merced who leads COVIDPoops19, which tracks wastewater monitoring efforts globally. Naughton is working with colleagues at the University of California-Davis to launch monitoring programs near where she works in the Central Valley but is finding that some smaller communities don\'t have the resources to conduct testing or sufficient health personnel to analyze or use the data., It\'s in these smaller communities with limited access to testing and doctors where the practice may hold the most promise, Naughton said. Covid laid bare long-standing inequities among communities that she fears will be perpetuated by the use of this new public health tool., Privacy concerns also need to be addressed, experts said. Wastewater data hasn\'t traditionally been considered protected personal health information the way diagnostic tests are. Health officials have managed earlier concerns about wastewater tracking of illicit drug use by sampling from large enough sewage streams to offer anonymity. But testing for certain health problems requires looking at DNA. \"I think that\'s going to be a challenge for public communication,\" Knight said, \"to make sure that\'s not perceived as essentially spying on every individual\'s genetic secrets.\", Public health and wastewater officials said they are thrilled by the potential of this new tool and are working on ways to address privacy concerns while taking advantage of it. Greg Kester, director of renewable resource programs at the California Association of Sanitation Agencies, wrote to CDC officials in June 2020 asking for a federal surveillance network. He can hardly believe how quickly that call became a reality. And he hopes it is here to stay, both for the ongoing pandemic and for the inevitable next outbreak., \"As vaccination rates increase and we get the variants, it\'s still going to be important because clinical testing is decreasing,\" Kester said. \"We really want to make this part of the infrastructure.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/13/health/wastewater-covid-disease-detection/index.html',1,301),(221,'FDA authorizes additional Covid-19 vaccine doses for certain immunocompromised people','The US Food and Drug Administration authorized an additional Covid-19 vaccine dose for certain immunocompromised people on Thursday. , The FDA amended the emergency use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines to allow for an additional dose for certain people with compromised immune systems. That group includes \"specifically, solid organ transplant recipients or those who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise,\" the agency wrote in a statement Thursday.,  , , \"The country has entered yet another wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the FDA is especially cognizant that immunocompromised people are particularly at risk for severe disease,\" Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said in a statement.  \"After a thorough review of the available data, the FDA determined that this small, vulnerable group may benefit from a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna Vaccines.\", , Currently three coronavirus vaccines are authorized for emergency use in the United States -- the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for people 12 and older and the two-dose Moderna vaccine and single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine for people 18 and older., All three are used under emergency use authorization by the FDA, but full approval is pending for Pfizer\'s vaccine. , , The CDC\'s Advisory Committee on  Immunization Practices is scheduled to meet on Friday to discuss booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines and additional doses for some immunocompromised people, according to a meeting agenda posted online. The committee is also scheduled to vote on Friday on whether to recommend additional doses of the vaccine for immunocompromised people., A recent study by Johns Hopkins researchers found that vaccinated immunocompromised people are 485 times more likely to end up in the hospital or die from Covid-19 compared to the general population that is vaccinated., Based on an estimate by the CDC, about 9 million Americans are immunocompromised, either because of diseases they have or medications they take., \"Emerging data show that certain people who are immune compromised, such as people who have had an organ transplant and some cancer patients, may not have had an adequate immune response to just two doses of the Covid vaccine,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said during a White House Covid-19 Response Team briefing on Thursday. \"To be clear, this is a very small population. We estimate it to be less than 3% of adults.\", It has been known for months that Covid-19 vaccines might not work well for this group. The hope was that vaccination rates overall would be so high so that the \"herd\" would protect them. But it didn\'t work out that way, because about a third of eligible people in the US have not received even one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine., The FDA also recommends immunocompromised individuals maintain other precautions, including physical distancing and masking. ,  \"In addition, close contacts of immunocompromised persons should get vaccinated, as appropriate for their health status, to provide increased protection to their loved ones,\" according to the FDA\'s statement on Thursday. ,  Additionally, FDA recommends immunocompromised people who contract or are exposed to Covid-19, check with their doctor about monoclonal antibody treatments., \'Inevitably, there will be a time when we\'ll have to give boosts\', Even for healthy people, some researchers and health officials have said they suspect the immunity against Covid-19 that vaccines elicit in the body might wane over time -- possibly after a year or more -- and might not protect as well against coronavirus variants that could emerge and evolve., , That might mean a vaccinated person would need a booster dose of vaccine to stay protected against the original coronavirus strain and newly emerging variants -- somewhat similar to how a tetanus booster is recommended every 10 years or different flu vaccines are recommended each year., But for the general public, health officials say that they are monitoring data closely to determine when a rollout of third doses may be needed more broadly., \"The important thing to point out is the differences between the immune compromised, who really never really got a good response to begin with, so for them it\'s more of getting them up to what they hopefully had gotten the first time around but we know because of their immune compromised they don\'t. That\'s different than the durability of response,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health, told NBC\'s Craig Melvin on the Today Show on Thursday., , \"No vaccine, at least not within this category, is going to have an indefinite amount of protection,\" Fauci said. , \"Inevitably, there will be a time when we\'ll have to give boosts. What we\'re doing literally on a weekly and monthly basis is following cohorts of patients to determine if, when and whom should get it. But right now at this moment, other than the immune compromised, we\'re not going to be giving boosters to people,\" he said. \"But we will be following them very carefully, and if they do need it, we\'ll be ready to give it to them.\", The Biden administration is expected to lay out a Covid-19 vaccine booster strategy for all vaccinated Americans in September.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/12/health/fda-covid-shots-immunocompromised-full/index.html',1,303),(222,'Moderna\'s Covid-19 vaccine protects against Delta variant, study finds','Moderna\'s Covid-19 vaccine protects people for at least six months and likely longer -- even against new variants, researchers reported Thursday.Protection against the Delta variant, now dominant across the US, barely waned, the National Institutes of Health-led team found. The team will continue to look for evidence of protection beyond six months., \"High levels of binding antibodies recognizing all tested variants, including B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta), were maintained in all subjects over this time period,\" immunologist Nicole Doria-Rose and colleagues at the NIH\'s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases wrote in their report, published in the journal Science., They tested blood from 24 fully vaccinated volunteers at several time points -- four weeks after the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, and then at three points after they were considered fully vaccinated with two doses -- up to six months out., , ,  \"At the peak of response to the second vaccine dose, all individuals had responses to all variants,\" the team wrote. Two weeks after the second dose of Moderna\'s vaccine, all the blood samples neutralized all of the variants, they found., They included all the most common or worrying variants in the test:  B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.429 (Epsilon), B.1.526 (Iota) and B.1.617.2 (Delta)., The variant most likely to elude immune protection was Beta, or B.1.351 -- the variant first seen in South Africa. Six months after the second dose, just over half of blood samples maintained antibodies that fully neutralized Beta variant samples. But at six months, 96% of samples had a full antibody response against the Delta variant, the team found., Antibodies don\'t tell the whole story, the researchers noted. Over time, people grow immune cells called B and T cells that also protect against viruses. , , , \"Individuals who demonstrate waning immune responses over time are likely to have memory B cells capable of delivering an anamnestic (boost) response to those variants in the or potentially with an additional dose of vaccine,\" they wrote., They also found only a little evidence that immunity wanes faster in older adults. They divided their blood samples into group by age., \"Importantly, many subjects in the oldest group retained neutralizing activity against the variants six months after the second vaccine dose,\" they wrote., , , Different variants have different genetic mutations, so they tested those one by one, also.

It\'s the health of our children, and there\'s really nothing more important than that,\" Murthy told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer., Before the FDA can evaluate a vaccine for children under 12, Murthy said, companies must complete their trials, collect the data and submit applications to the agency. , Whereas the elderly were once considered the population most vulnerable to the virus, the age constraints around vaccinations have left children most at risk now, CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner told CNN\'s Don Lemon. , Wen said that it\'s clear what\'s required to make school safe for children -- layers of protection. , When one layer is removed, like when social distancing is foregone so students can gather in a classroom, the other layers of virus protection become even more crucial, she said. Those layers include at least a three-ply surgical mask, improved ventilation, vaccination and testing., \"Putting all that together is how we can get kids back in school safely,\" Wen said. , , The clock is ticking to authorize vaccines for children, expert says, Currently, Covid-19 vaccines are only authorized for people 12 and older, but many experts and officials have called for the efforts to approve vaccines for younger children to be expedited before more children are infected., , \"I think the clock is ticking.

Some 36% of the parents said schools should not have a mask requirement for the unvaccinated., In Oklahoma, Santa Fe South Schools announced that it will require masks at school beginning Thursday, defying a law the state Legislature passed last year., \"Exemptions will be made only for those who have a physician\'s documentation stating that wearing of a mask is not recommended for that individual,\" Superintendent Chris Brewster said in a letter posted on the district website., Kentucky Gov.

I think we\'re dealing with the Delta variant, which is a different ballgame than we\'ve had before with Covid-19 and school is just around the corner,\" Wiedermann said. \"So things are starting to ramp up and parents and kids are getting anxious about that.\" , Parents, doctors, and even President Joe Biden have voiced their concern about the growing number of children who are getting Covid-19. Children have largely been spared the worst of Covid-19 -- hospitalizations and deaths are still rare -- but cases have been rising, and without a vaccine, they remain vulnerable., Pediatricians say FDA needs to act faster, The American Academy of Pediatrics understands parents\' anxiety and impatience. AAP President Dr. Lee Savio Beers said there needs to be more urgency around the authorization of the Covid-19 vaccine for young children in the United States., \"It\'s really important to make sure that we are approaching authorization of the Covid vaccine for our youngest children with the same urgency that we did in adults,\" Beers told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday. \"It really is a very urgent situation.\", Beers\' organization wrote a letter to Acting US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock last week urging the FDA not to slow down authorization., Last month, the FDA asked Pfizer and Moderna to double the number of children ages 5 to 11 in clinical trials. The FDA also asked for six months of follow-up safety data, instead of the two months it asked for with adults., \"While we appreciate this prudent step to gather more safety data, we urge FDA to carefully consider the impact of this decision on the timeline for authorizing a vaccine for this age group,\" the letter said. , The AAP argued the FDA should authorize the vaccines for kids ages 5 to 11 based on the initial trial data already available. Two months of safety data should also be enough, it said., \"Waiting on a 6-month follow-up will significantly hinder the ability to reduce the spread of the hyper infectious Covid-19 delta variant,\" the letter said., Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in June there is a likely association between the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines and extremely rare cases of heart inflammation in adolescents and young adults, but the benefits of vaccination still clearly outweigh the risks. The inflammation cases appeared to be mild, and they resolved quickly on their own or with minimal treatment., \"There is no biological plausibility for serious adverse immunological or inflammatory events to occur more than two month after Covid-19 vaccine administration,\" the letter said., US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Wednesday the FDA will \"move fast\" to evaluate data from vaccine companies once it\'s ready, and it\'s possible a Covid-19 vaccine will be available for kids under the age of 12 before the end of 2021., \"If everything were to go well, and everything were to fall into place, I think it\'s possible that we could see a vaccine before the end of the calendar year for kids under 12,\" Murthy told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer., \"Make no mistake, the FDA will move quickly on this because they recognize what\'s at stake. It\'s the health of our children, and there\'s really nothing more important than that.\", No \'luxury\' of time for additional data, Still, Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a Stanford professor of pediatric infectious diseases who was on the AAP committee that helped draft the letter, is concerned the FDA is slowing down authorization unnecessarily., \"We don\'t have the luxury of being able to sit back and wait for additional data like this to roll in,\" said Maldonado, who is also a lead investigator at the Stanford site of Pfizer-BioNTech\'s pediatric vaccine trial. \"We have to make some decisions based on best practices.\", Maldonado is concerned the FDA is listening too closely to its critics., \"We can\'t stop now because people are second guessing what the FDA is doing,\" said Maldonado. , Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA\'s vaccine advisory committee, said he can\'t understand why the FDA requested more data. \"The longer follow up for safety doesn\'t make sense. You just really need just two months,\" Offit said. , He hopes his committee will be given data from the trials to review soon., \"You know I\'m frustrated,\" Offit said. \"As we move further into the fall this puts children at greater risk.\", Dr. Bill Muller, who has been working on the Moderna pediatric trials, thinks some parts of the trial process have gone too slowly, but he is in favor of additional data., \"We have to be really cautious about expanding the authorization to really large population of patients,\" said Muller, scientific director at community and clinical trials, Stanley Manne Children\'s Research Institute., \"That doesn\'t mean we need to be overly cautious,\" said Muller, who is an attending physicians in pediatric infectious diseases at Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children\'s Hospital of Chicago. \"The question is really going to be one of balance.\", With the more contagious Delta variant, Covid-19 cases among children have been on the rise since early July after months of decline. Almost 94,000 cases among children were added in the past week, the American Academy of Pediatrics said in what the group described as a \"continuing substantial increase.\", The vast majority of children don\'t end up in the hospital, but as of Saturday, the number of children who were newly hospitalized saw a 21% increase week over week, according to the CDC., Why child trials are necessary, Before a vaccine can be tested in children, scientists test it on adults. , \"It\'s to protect children and to protect their safety and well-being,\" said Dr. Daniel B. Blatt of Norton Children\'s and University of Louisville School of Medicine, who has been working on the Covid-19 pediatric trials for the Pfizer vaccine. , Typically, investigators use what\'s called an age deescalation model, he said. Scientists start with adults, and once they see that it is safe to do so, they move the study onto older children, and then younger children. It\'s a time consuming, but necessary process., While the Covid-19 vaccines have been proven to be safe and protective in millions of people, scientists can\'t just extrapolate that out to younger children., \"Kids aren\'t just miniature-sized adults, their immune systems are different,\" said Dr. Katherine Luzuriaga,  professor of molecular medicine, pediatrics and medicine at UMass Medical School, who is working on the Moderna pediatric trial. \"The way they respond can sometimes be different.\", In a trial, scientists start the research by essentially making their best educated guess on what dose would be safe and generate an immune response to protect the child from getting Covid-19. , \"It\'s that kind of Goldilocks approach that\'s not too big, not too small,\" Luzuriaga said., All along the way, there\'s an evaluation of the data to make sure there\'s no concerns about the safety of the product., Vaccine timeline for younger children, \"I think by late fall, we will have, if everything goes well, hopefully, enough information and data to support us for that age group,\" Luzuriaga said., Data for children 5 to 11 could come sometime in September, depending on the findings, Pfizer told CNN it could ask the FDA to authorize the vaccine that same month. , Data for 2-to-5-year-olds could arrive soon after. For the youngest children, Pfizer said it could potentially get data in October or November, and shortly thereafter ask the FDA to authorize emergency use., Emergency use considerations by the FDA can take several weeks, meaning a vaccine for younger children likely won\'t be available until late fall or even next year., Pediatricians never feel like things are moving fast enough, especially when they have a patient sitting in front of them that needs something, Luzuriaga said -- but research takes time. , \"I think we\'re getting close,\" Luzuriaga said. , Moderna told CNN it expects data later this year or toward the beginning of 2022. There may also be interim data at various stages in the trial, but that timeline is hard to predict., Johnson &amp; Johnson told CNN that it has used its small trial with 16- and 17-year-olds from earlier in the year to design four late stage studies for younger children, and the company is in \"active discussions with regulatory authorities regarding our development plan and trial designs.\" The company anticipates those trials will start in the fall. , \"To keep children safe, and ultimately to achieve herd immunity, it is imperative that COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials continue to move forward in this population, and we remain deeply committed to the critical work needed to make our COVID-19 vaccine equitably accessible for all age groups,\" a J&amp;J spokesperson told CNN Wednesday., Protecting children before vaccines, While younger children don\'t have the protection of the vaccine yet, others can help protect them. , \"If we\'re going to give our fighting chance to have a successful school year, we\'re going to need everyone who is vaccine eligible to get vaccinated and everybody masked,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine told CNN on Monday., Physical distance, good ventilation, good hand hygiene and masks are all essential, especially as kids head back to school. , \"These things, while they\'re not ideal, we\'d love to get to the point where we can vaccinate kids and hopefully pull back some of these measures,\" Luzuriaga said. \"But we\'re not at that level yet.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/12/health/covid-19-kid-vaccine-why-its-taking-so-long/index.html',1,309),(226,'School openings so far reveal science is right -- masking works','As schools start classes across the United States, public health experts warn that the politics around masks could hinder the nation\'s fight against Covid-19 . But the real-life evidence about masks leaves little doubt that they work. , In some places where schools have been open for a while now, such as Georgia and Hawaii, public health experts notice what happens when schools follow the science: classes go on without disruption as long staff and students wear masks. , But when staff and students do not wear masks, Covid-19 can spread, forcing people to stay home to quarantine and classes returning to virtual learning., , In just this week schools have closed, at least temporarily, in Georgia, Indiana and Mississippi due to cluster outbreaks among students and staff., On Wednesday, in an elementary school in Cobb County in the suburbs of Atlanta, fifth graders were sent home for virtual learning due to high numbers of Covid-19 cases, according to a school district email sent to parents and obtained by CNN. Masks are optional for students and staff at the school, according to the district\'s website, but there is social distancing in classrooms when possible., \"This morning, based on our district protocols and at the guidance of the Department of Public Health in coordination with district leaders, we\'ve had to make the difficult decision to have our 5th-grade classes move to virtual learning due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and high positive case numbers,\" the email from East Side Elementary reads., Students will be in virtual learning until Friday, August 20, and return to their classrooms the following Monday. , , The Glascock County Consolidated School in Gibson, Georgia is also in virtual classes until at least August 20. Within the first week of school nine students and four staff members tested positive and 99 students and 11 staff had to quarantine. , In Indiana, the Scott County School District 1 told parents on Tuesday that \"due to the high rate of positive cases and extremely high rate of student in quarantine\" it would switch to virtual learning starting Wednesday., Several schools in Lamar County, Mississippi switched to virtual learning before the school board voted to maintain a hybrid teaching model. During a board meeting on Monday, Superintendent Steven Hampton said while he believes face-to-face learning is best, a hybrid model would help avoid having all of the schools go virtual., Politics, but no masks, in the classroom, The National Education Association, the largest teachers\' union in the United States, has been watching the reopening of schools closely., \"In places where the schools have highly communicative, collaborative relationships with educators and parents and community members, and they have an ongoing almost constant system of communication about the factors around their safety plans and reopening, things are going better,\" Kim Anderson, executive director of the National Education Association, told CNN., \"In places where they\'re not communicating well and in places where politicians are trying to strip the ability of communities to try to protect themselves, things are not going well.\", , Implementing mask requirements in schools has become a politicized topic of debate in some states across the country. As of last week, at least seven states -- Arkansas, Arizona, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah -- prohibit districts from requiring masks in schools. , But there have been some efforts to fight back., In Arkansas, a county circuit judge has temporarily blocked the enforcement of the state\'s law banning mask mandates in schools, in response to lawsuits filed by a school district and parents. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott prohibits mask mandates, but two judges there have issued restraining orders temporarily blocking the enforcement of Abbott\'s order., Meanwhile, there is an ongoing battle in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order directing health and education departments to leave it to parents to decide if students wear masks. His office said on Monday that the state board of education could withhold the salaries of superintendents and school board members who disregard the governor\'s executive order, which effectively prohibits mask mandates., , Public health officials have been urging schools and parents to keep politics out of the classroom. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the US National Institutes of Health, implored parents on Sunday to see masks for what they really are., \"This is not a political statement or invasion of your liberties. This is a life-saving medical device, and asking kids to wear a mask is uncomfortable, but kids are pretty resilient,\" Collins told ABC\'s George Stephanopoulos on This Week., \"If we don\'t have masks in schools, this virus will spread more widely. It will probably result in outbreaks in schools and kids will have to go back to remote learning, which is the one thing we really want to prevent,\" Collins said., Follow the science, end up in the classroom, Several studies have shown that masks are effective at reducing the spread of Covid-19., In June, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that other mitigation measures -- such as physical distancing and handwashing -- are \"insufficient by themselves\" in curbing the pandemic without mask use, too., Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said last week during a town hall event in Boston that officials are following every jurisdiction and tracking outbreaks that occur in camps and schools. , \"The places that are having a problem, the places that are having disease that is transmitted in the schools, are the places that are not taking prevention strategies -- the places that aren\'t masking,\" Walensky said. \"The places where you see kids in the hospital, the places where you see footage of kids in the hospital, are all places that are not taking mitigation strategies to keep our children safe.\", \'Like adding gasoline to an already lit fire\', Dr. Andrew Pavia, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah and an expert with the Infectious Diseases Society of America, told CNN it\'s still not possible right now to make predictions about how the school year will turn out. , , \"We expect that for school systems that are not using universal masking and are in communities with high levels of transmission can anticipate spread in schools. It may take several weeks to judge to full impact,\" Pavia wrote in an email to CNN., \"Predictions are challenging, but we expect that school districts that employ layered strategies as recommended by the CDC will have a relatively successful school year.\", Dr. Bayo Curry-Winchell, regional medical director and family physician at Carbon Health in Reno, Nevada, anticipates that more school districts will require masking, Covid-19 testing and other mitigation efforts in the next month or so., \"The Dallas and Austin Independent School Districts are even defying Texas Governor Greg Abbott\'s mask mandate ban and requiring all students, staff and visitors to wear masks,\" she said. \"In regions where state or city officials aren\'t implementing mask mandates, school districts will need to take the lead.\", , Experts are calling for these prevention measures now in order to avoid more rises in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations among children later. , As of Tuesday, an average of 203 children with Covid-19 were admitted to US hospitals every day over the past week, CDC data shows. That\'s a more than 21% increase from the previous week in daily new hospitalizations among Covid-19 patients up to age 17., In late July, an internal CDC document noted that the Delta coronavirus variant surging across the United States appears to cause more severe illness and can spread as easily as chickenpox -- detailing that one person infected with the Delta variant could spread the virus to five to eight other people on average. With chickenpox, each infected person, on average, can infect eight or nine others., , Schools that haven\'t opened yet, but are preparing to in the coming weeks, should realize children are at risk of getting sick, Dr. Purvi Parikh an allergist and immunologist at NYU Langone Health in New York and a spokesperson for the Allergy and Asthma Network, told CNN., \"Schools should be very concerned as children are not only getting infected but are also sick enough to fill up children\'s hospitals. Further, many children still aren\'t vaccinated,\" Parikh wrote, adding that she would encourage vaccinations for all who are eligible and recommend masking and physical distancing in classrooms., \"We will see more cases and outbreaks. Even before the pandemic we saw an increase in viral infections and hospitalizations when schools reopened due to flu, RSV, and other viruses. Now with a highly contagious variant in a pandemic it is like adding gasoline to an already lit fire,\" Parikh wrote. \"Children need in person learning, let\'s help them get it safely.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/12/health/covid-19-schools-openings-masks-wellness/index.html',1,310),(227,'What\'s in a name? The term \'breakthrough infection\' raises doubts about vaccines, but it shouldn\'t','In most cases, a \"breakthrough\" means a sudden, dramatic or important discovery. With Covid-19, however, the expression has been used to describe an infection that \"broke\" through the protective immunity of the vaccine -- and this is sometimes misinterpreted as a sign the vaccine is not working.  For the public health community and the scientists who helped create the vaccines, however, \"breakthrough infection\" signifies just the opposite: proof the vaccine is doing its job, just as it should., It is confusing: How well do the vaccines really work and what does it mean if someone still becomes infected after being vaccinated? , First, let\'s take a look at the data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which was analyzed by CNN\'s health team. More than 164 million people in the United States were fully vaccinated against Covid-19 as of early August. Our analysis of the agency\'s data found fewer than 0.001% of those individuals -- 1,507 people -- died and fewer than 0.005% -- 7,101 people -- were reported to the CDC as having been hospitalized with Covid-19. Reporting to the CDC is not mandatory, but 49 states do contribute to these totals, which means the CDC views these numbers as a useful snapshot of how well the vaccine is working. The data suggest that more than 99.99% of fully vaccinated people have not had a breakthrough case of Covid-19 resulting in hospitalization or death. , While it\'s true that some of that data come from a time before the Delta variant swept over the country and rates of infection have since increased, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey released in July found that, of the more than 18 states that reported data, at least 95 out of every 100 hospitalizations and deaths were in the unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated. , At the same time, however, many of us know someone who, after being fully vaccinated, has tested positive for the coronavirus and showed symptoms. I know several, as well. Maybe it\'s your kid\'s teacher, your brother-in-law, your neighbor, your coworker or your mechanic. And while it\'s great news that we can leave chicken soup at their door instead of attending their memorial service, it makes the phenomenon seem very real and not at all \"rare\" -- so we should probably stop describing them that way. In fact, because vaccinated individuals are not getting tested very often, we have no idea how common these infections really are. , The whole situation really got me to thinking about the term \"breakthrough infections\" and whether it is even the right phrase. To me, it doesn\'t seem nuanced enough to describe what\'s going on; it only serves to alarm those of us who are already vaccinated, and potentially discourage those who are hesitant.   , In search of a better term, I soon learned that there are other scientists who don\'t like the phrase \"breakthrough infection\" either.,  , \"I hate it because it emphasizes something that a lot of [other] vaccines, we know, do,\" said Dr. Carlos Del Rio, distinguished professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Emory University School of Medicine. \"We don\'t talk about flu cases and say we have \'breakthrough\' infections, we talked about the efficacy. ... I think breakthrough has become a term that is equated with lack of efficacy.\" , Del Rio noted that the vaccines were specifically designed to protect against severe disease and death, and that\'s what those big vaccine trials looked for. \"Infection was never an end-point in these studies,\" he said. , That the vaccines were later found to prevent infection, he said \"was a little bit ... like the cherry on the cake.\", The phrasing also bothers immunologist and virologist Dr. Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, whose lab played a key role in the development of the Moderna vaccine. , Graham described it in a way that really made me visualize the vaccine\'s effect on your body., \"The vaccines were always designed to focus against disease in the lower airways [the lungs] -- not in the upper airways [the nose and upper throat],\" he explained. , Think about that. According to Graham, a person becomes severely ill when the virus enters the lungs, and that is exactly where the vaccines offer up their most protective barrier. You see, the vaccines trigger the creation of immunoglobulins, which are proteins that function as antibodies. The main one generated by the vaccines is immunoglobulin G (IgG) which easily moves from the blood into the lower airways (the lungs) where it can block the virus. The level of IgG in blood needed to penetrate the tissues of the upper airways (the nose and throat) is much higher and that is why it is more difficult to block the virus from growing in the nose. , \"That\'s why we see such consistency in the efficacy against severe disease. It wasn\'t designed to protect the upper airways as much,\" he explained. , It is also why Graham said scientists weren\'t expecting the vaccines to prevent infection as much. \"We got very lucky that it did to some extent, against earlier strains,\" he added. , And, while the Delta variant is more transmissible, meaning more infections will certainly occur overall in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated, there will be a bigger difference between the two groups when it comes to protection against severe disease compared to protection against mild or asymptomatic illness, Graham explained. That\'s clear from data that show the overwhelming majority of hospitalizations and deaths happen in the unvaccinated, not the vaccinated.  , President Joe Biden\'s chief medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID and Graham\'s boss, agrees. , \"The vaccines are doing exactly what we\'re asking them to do when it comes to keeping you out of the hospital, out of serious disease and certainly preventing your death,\" Fauci said at a White House Covid-19 Response briefing last week. , \"An important point to bring up is that the greater the percentage of people that are vaccinated, even with a high degree of protection, the absolute number of breakthrough infections might appear high,\" he said. , But that\'s just because there are more people vaccinated. It\'s simple math. Think of it like this: If 100% of people were vaccinated, then every new infection would have to be in a vaccinated person, right? But in that scenario, only a tiny number of people who died would die from Covid-19. More than 99% of the deaths we\'re seeing now would almost certainly be avoided., Another way to make sense of the seemingly large numbers: If 1 million people are vaccinated against the make-believe virus \"X\" and 1% get infected, that\'s 10,000 infections in vaccinated people. But if 100 million people are vaccinated, and 1% get infected, that\'s 1 million infections. Obviously 1 million is orders of magnitude larger than 10,000, but it is still the same proportion: 1%. , Fauci said that the \"critical number\" is the proportion -- not the raw number -- of the vaccinated people who are getting breakthrough infections. And within that raw number, severe illness and death are the outcomes we so desperately want to avoid. , , As he reiterated during the White House briefing, \"Covid vaccines give strong protection against the Delta variant, and it protects you, your family and your community... For disease itself, It\'s an eight-fold reduction. For hospitalization, 25-fold reduction and for death, 25-fold reduction.\" , But exact numbers on \"breakthrough infections\" are hard to pin down. Again, part of that is because there is no nationwide data available on asymptomatic and mild breakthrough cases. And we also don\'t routinely test the vaccinated, only people who are experiencing symptoms or who require a negative Covid test for travel. , For example, I recently went to Tokyo for the Olympics, and was tested several times before and during my travel. While I felt fine, and have been very careful, I still would not have been totally shocked if one of those tests had come back positive. Luckily, they didn\'t. , Immunity wanes over time, Another factor that may impact the number of so-called breakthrough cases (and our perception of how effective our vaccines are) is that our level of coronavirus antibodies -- whether acquired through natural infection or a vaccine -- generally wanes over time. , Scientists are studying the question of immunity over time, and we still need more data in order to know for sure how long protection from the coronavirus lasts. But even if immunity among the vaccinated is found to decrease months or years after the second shot, that still doesn\'t mean the vaccine isn\'t working., \"This isn\'t a glitch,\" said Dr. Monica Gandhi, professor of medicine and associate division chief of the Division of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine at University of California San Francisco and San Francisco General Hospital. , \"This is how the immune system is designed,\" she explained. \"It\'s normal for immunoglobulins to reduce over time.\" She said our blood and our noses can\'t hold all of the antibodies they\'ve ever produced; if antibody levels didn\'t drop, \"our blood would be thick as paste.\", And as our antibodies wane in places like our nose, where the virus might enter our body, Gandhi said we might be more susceptible to mild infection., \"So it really is not really a function of the vaccine; it has to do with this is how our immune systems work,\" she said. , At the same time though, our immune system is pretty smart and resourceful; it contains cells such as memory B cells that will start churning out new antibodies within days of encountering a familiar virus or bacteria., Gandhi said when our antibody levels drop, we can wear a mask to avoid even that mild exposure. And, we may consider getting a booster shot or eventually an intranasal vaccine (which is not yet on the market). The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to make a decision about boosters soon. , The issue of transmissibility,  As an added bonus of getting vaccinated (or having had a previous Covid infection), Gandhi said that when T cells, another important immune system soldier, encounter the virus in our nose, they attack the virus, leaving it weakened. So even if a Covid-19 test detects the virus\' genetic material, that doesn\'t mean the virus is necessarily as infectious as it would be in someone who wasn\'t vaccinated. , , Gandhi and Graham both made this important point: The viral load -- how much virus is in an infected person\'s body -- also seems to go down much more quickly in the vaccinated than in the unvaccinated, which has big implications for transmissibility. , Graham explained that, while it\'s true that the Delta variant creates a higher initial viral load than with previous strains, in the vaccinated, that viral load drops off faster and people don\'t shed it as long. , \"Right now there are data that suggest that vaccinated and unvaccinated [people] have the same level at a particular time point,\" said Graham. \"But if you follow that over time, the vaccinated people\'s viral load drops much faster. ... There\'s still a lot less virus in vaccinated people than there is (in) unvaccinated people. So there would be less transmission going on in vaccinated people, but there may be some transmission ... It\'s just a matter of degrees; it\'s a little nuanced.\", Time to change?, So maybe it\'s time to shelve the freighted term \"breakthrough infection\" and look for a new name. After all, the vaccine isn\'t like building an impenetrable fortress around our house that gets broken through. It\'s more like stationing sentries -- lookouts -- who can give early warning of an imminent attack and get the rank-and-file immune system soldiers ready to defend., An alternative phrase I\'ve heard in some circles is \"post-vaccine infection.\" I like it because it doesn\'t carry the connotation of vaccine failure -- it\'s just a neutral term for what we expect to happen in some people over the course of time. , As Emory\'s Del Rio pointed out, words matter. \"I think \'breakthrough,\' while virologically and technically may be the right term, [for the general public] it may not be the right term,\" he said., Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, also thinks it\'s misleading. , \"I think the term is terrible because it\'s scaring people and making it sound as if the vaccines don\'t work. Let me say very clearly: The vaccines are incredibly effective in preventing hospitalizations, severe cases -- over 90%. So, let\'s not let the language get in the way of that,\" he said on CNN last week. , I wholeheartedly agree. In fact, at this point, there is really nothing that should get in the way of getting vaccinated.

But there is hope for those who want to quit thanks to innovative apps, help lines and proven coping strategies.In 2019, more than 34 million Americans smoked, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  That was almost 14% of Americans 18 and older., Cigarettes have chemicals that can make this addiction particularly insidious.  , Despite the steep uphill battle, the addiction can be overcome. Here are five actions you can take to help you or a loved one quit smoking and enjoy a healthier life: , 1. Focus on how to \'stay quit\' , , The goal should not be to quit smoking; rather, it should be on how to \"stay quit,\" said Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, director of the Tobacco Treatment Clinic at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. , He said he\'s had patients who say they\'ve quit many times, but that they\'ve not been able to permanently stop., He recommends people break up their larger goal of quitting into smaller goals. , For example, learn your different triggers that could make you want to smoke. That way,  you can be mindful and find solutions for those actions., 2. Make each time you quit a learning experience, Most people who smoke quit eight to 12 times, because of  the addictiveness of cigarettes, before they successfully quit for good, said Jonathan Bricker, professor in the public health sciences division at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center at the University of Washington in Seattle. , Because relapse is so common, Bricker tells his patients to find a lesson they can take from each experience. , \"People will say things like, \'I learned how powerful these cravings are, or I learned how seeing my friend smoke was a big trigger for me, or I learned that stress in my life was a big trigger,\' \" Bricker said., Patients should approach quitting from the viewpoint that the more things they learn from their relapses, the greater their chance is of quitting permanently, he said. , 3. Use phone lines and apps for support, , Support groups for people who want to quit smoking are dwindling, so Bricker recommended calling a quitting help line  to get outside assistance., The CDC funds a tobacco cessation hotline, 1-800-QUIT-NOW (784-8669), which is free to US residents in all states, plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. Your call goes automatically the quit line in your state or territory., Callers are connected to coaches who help smokers create a plan to quit and give them advice when facing withdrawals and cravings., Currently, state cessation hotlines only reach about 1% of people who smoke, which the CDC largely attributes to the lack of funding to promote the service., Bricker\'s team at Fred Hutch helped to create the app iCanQuit, which was supported by a grant from the US National Institutes of Health. , The app focuses on acceptance and commitment therapy, which  encourages people to accept their emotions and thoughts instead of pushing them away. The tool also offers resources for quitting and handling cravings when they arise, Bricker said., RELATED: Apps that help you acknowledge your smoking triggers work better, study shows, 4. Speak to your medical provider, , People who want to quit smoking can talk to their medical provider to come up with a treatment plan filled with multiple strategies, Galiatsatos said. , Doctors can prescribe medication to curb cigarette cravings and make them more manageable, he said. It\'s a short-term solution to help train your brain to not crave cigarettes as strongly, Bricker added., The medications doctors provide will depend on your specific situation, Bricker said. The prescriptions tend to be minimal at first then escalate depending on the severity of the addiction., 5. Support people addicted to smoking, Galiatsatos said he\'s never come across a patient who doesn\'t already know that smoking is bad, so he recommends avoiding that argument when appealing to a  love one who smokes. , \"If you are really serious about helping your loved one quit, you have to approach it as pro-smoker and anti-smoking,\" he said., When trying to help  someone who smokes, make it clear that you are approaching the situation with no stigma or  judgment, Galiatsatos said. , Once trust is established, he recommends friends and family members offer to help smokers find resources on how to quit smoking. , Medical providers should also be supportive of their patients who smoke, Galiatsatos said., If patients feel judged by their doctors for smoking, they might just lie about it. And that doesn\'t help anyone, he said., Even when patients don\'t feel motivated to quit smoking that day, it\'s important to outline the different treatment options so they have the resources later . , Why is smoking so addictive anyway?, , Cigarettes are filled with chemicals such as nicotine, which are chemically enhanced to drive that addiction, said Galiatsatos., The chemically enhanced nicotine closely resembles the common neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which helps control muscle movement and other brain functions., RELATED: Smokers may be at greater risk of depression, study finds, When the nicotine fits into the acetylcholine receptors, your body releases dopamine, the \"feel-good\" brain chemical. When the dopamine goes away, people begin craving another cigarette., \"I always tell people this is the most insidious addictive molecule known to man because it doesn\'t just overdose you,\" said Galiatsatos, who is also a volunteer medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association. , It rewires the smoker\'s brain over years and years, and \"by the time someone realizes it\'s robbing them of their health, it\'s incredibly hard to break that addiction.\", Despite the daunting effort it takes, never forget -- it is possible to overcome this addiction and enjoy better health., ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/15/health/how-to-quit-smoking-wellness/index.html',1,313),(229,'Schools reopening without masking is \'formula for disaster,\' Louisiana children\'s hospital doctor says','Opening schools full of unvaccinated children without requiring them to wear masks or take other precautions is a recipe for disaster, the physician-in-chief of Children\'s Hospital New Orleans says.\"I think bringing together large numbers of children, congregating them in classrooms with masks being optional -- or worse yet even, forbidden -- is just a formula for disaster,\" Dr. Mark Kline told CNN\'s Don Lemon., Kline cited Louisiana\'s mask mandate for schools and said it would be wise for governors across the region to follow suit., \"This virus that we\'re dealing with now is a game changer, and it\'s just so easily transmitted from person-to-person that this could truly catalyze an explosion of cases across the region,\" he added., It\'s not just students who could soon see mandates. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on MSNBC on Tuesday that he thinks vaccines for teachers should be mandated., \"We are in a critical situation now,\" he said. \"We\'ve had 615,000-plus deaths and we are in a major surge now as we\'re going into the fall, into the school season. This is very serious business. You would wish that people would see why it\'s so important to get vaccinated.\" , As Americans gear up for a new school year against a backdrop of rising Covid-19 cases, experts say there is no time to waste in getting already rising vaccination rates even higher., For the first time since mid-June, the US is currently averaging more than half a million people initiating vaccinations a day. At 503,734 new vaccinations, that\'s a 13% increase over last week\'s pace, according to data published Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., Though the improvements are promising, more Americans still need to get vaccinated as quickly as possible, especially considering that it takes six weeks from the first injection for people to be fully protected, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, a former CDC director., Just over half of the total population is fully vaccinated, while about 31% of the vaccine-eligible population has not been vaccinated. , The large swath of the population still unvaccinated is even more of a concern as cases rise. With an average of more than 116,600 new Covid-19 cases per day, it\'s the highest in about six months, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. , And rates of hospitalizations and deaths have almost doubled in the past two weeks. More than 68,000 people are hospitalized with Covid-19, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services., More than 99.99% of people who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 have not had a breakthrough case resulting in hospitalization or death, according to a CNN analysis of data from the CDC., But as effective as vaccines are, Frieden said that with rates too low, vaccination may need to be paired with mask mandates. , \"What we know really well is that vaccines work and masks work,\" he said. \"Doubling the protection is particularly important because we have this doubly infectious variant of Delta. , School mask mandate debate escalates, Concerns over the rise in cases are growing for many as parents begin to send their children to school for the new year. , A CNN analysis from August 5 found that at least seven states -- Arkansas, Arizona, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah -- prohibit districts from requiring masks in schools., On August 6, an Arkansas judge temporarily blocked the enforcement of the state\'s law banning mask mandates in schools, in response to two lawsuits -- one from a school district, and one from parents -- who want schools to be able to require masks if they so choose. School districts are allowed to enforce mask mandates while the suit continues., Florida does not technically ban school districts from requiring masks, but Gov. Ron DeSantis has pulled other levers to reach the same point. The governor\'s office said in a statement Monday the state board of education \"could\" move to withhold the salary of the district superintendent or school board members in districts that made masks mandatory in schools., Leon County Schools Superintendent Rocky Hanna in Florida on Monday announced that his district will start the school year with a temporary mask requirement. , The move \"speaks against\" what DeSantis and state health officials have said, Hanna said, but if a child was lost to the virus, he couldn\'t blame the governor, saying \"that\'s on me.\", \"And if there\'s an out and I didn\'t take the out, and I didn\'t do what was best for the children here in Tallahassee and Leon County, that\'s on me,\" Hanna said. \"Every time I looked at myself in the mirror it would be really hard to answer to that guy.\", Hanna told school officials at a meeting Monday afternoon that \"you can\'t put a price tag on someone\'s life, including my salary,\" according to reporting by the  Tallahassee Democrat. , Alachua County Superintendent Carlee Simon, whose school district also is defying DeSantis\' attempted ban on mask mandates, said she doesn\'t believe he\'s taking the surge in cases in northeast Florida seriously., \"The governor should take the conservative step and do everything he can to protect the lives everyone in our community,\" Simon told CNN\'s Lemon. \"I believe the governor has other interests that he\'s focusing on,\" Simon added., DeSantis Tuesday defended his ban on school mask mandates saying, for him, \"It is about parental choice, not government mandate.\", The governor said \"a lot of parents\" have come to him and complained that masking is hard on their children in a learning environment., Schools are scheduled to reopen Tuesday in Florida and Simon says she and other school officials are concerned about the rising positivity rate in the state., \"My goal is to make sure that I provide the high quality education and this is a direction I believe I need to go,\" Simon said. \"It\'s concerning because we need to be able to run schools and we need to make sure that people aren\'t testing positive or needing to quarantine.\", One health expert said that vaccine mandates for children 12 to 17 may be necessary as the new school year begins., Speaking about the rise in pediatric ICU admissions in certain parts of the country, Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatrician and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer that \"schools are going to be an accelerant\" for child infections without universal masking. , \"It\'s not even going to be enough to have mask mandates in the schools,\" he said. \"We need all of the adolescents vaccinated, and really we need to move towards vaccine mandates for the 12 to 17-year-olds in the schools.\", Some states only have a quarter of the adolescent population vaccinated, Hotez said, so both mask and an increase in vaccination rates among students will be important to containing in-school spread., \"If we\'re going to give our fighting chance to have a successful school year, we\'re going to need everyone who is vaccine eligible to get vaccinated and everybody masked,\" Hotez said., Hospitals are filling up, Some states are reporting that intensive care units are full or are nearing capacity., Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said on Monday that the state had just eight available ICU beds as it reported its largest single-day increase in hospitalizations., \"I think we\'re in worse position, in terms of our ICU beds, than we were in January ... largely because of the other health needs that we have that occupy ICU beds,\" Hutchinson said at a news briefing Tuesday., \"Everybody has to realize that now\'s not a good time to get sick, because space is limited,\" the governor said. , Mississippi\'s senior health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, on Monday tweeted that the state has no ICU beds at its level 1, 2 and 3 hospitals, and more than 200 patients were waiting in emergency rooms for a hospital room. , In Texas, the Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital in Houston has erected tents as an expansion for patients as its ICU capacity is at 100% with 63% Covid cases, Harris Health spokesperson Bryan McLeod told CNN in an email Monday. , Texas Gov. Greg Abbott sent a letter to the Texas Hospital Association asking hospitals to voluntarily postpone elective medical procedures to increase hospital capacity for coronavirus patients, according to a news release from his office Monday.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/10/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html',1,314),(230,'Ahead of official vaccine guidance, some Americans are already caught up in \'booster mania\' ','For his two-dose Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, Ted Rall crossed state lines back in February and March. Appointments in New York City were impossible to come by, but his friend told him about a federal facility in New Jersey with no residency requirements and so he drove there twice. The Covid-19 shot Rall had at the end of July -- his third -- was a lot easier to get his hands on and far more convenient, he says, even though the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention don\'t currently recommend Covid-19 vaccine boosters for anyone., Rall, 57, simply walked into a CVS pharmacy in Manhattan, no appointment needed, and told the pharmacist he wanted to get a Covid-19 vaccine. He pretended it was his first dose. , Rall, a political cartoonist and writer, says he has asthma and a history of serious respiratory disease including swine flu and pneumonia. He suspects he had Covid-19 early in the pandemic, though his antibody tests were negative. He isn\'t interested in taking any chances now that the more transmissible Delta variant is ravaging the country and more than 98% of the US population lives in counties considered to have \"high\" or \"substantial\" Covid-19 transmission, according to the CDC. , \"I want to stay protected, you know, and I think it\'s also pretty obvious that this is going to be the norm, and it might just be like in a month or two,\" Rall told CNN. \"Everyone\'s going to be doing it, so why wait until it\'s hard to get appointments again?\", Rall could be right about the timeline. A Biden administration official told CNN last week that internal discussions at the FDA are looking at early September to lay out a strategy on Covid-19 booster shots. A decision for those who are immunocompromised and face greater risk from the virus is expected sooner, the official said. , Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will meet Friday to discuss boosters and additional doses for immunocompromised people., And the FDA is already considering full approval of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, a decision that some say could occur in a matter of weeks. All of the Covid-19 vaccines are currently available in the US under emergency use authorization. Full approval could mean that the fully vaccinated could get an additional vaccine -- well before any recommendation for boosters -- if a doctor thinks it\'s warranted., The available vaccines provide strong protection for most people, but studies have shown that people who are immocompromised don\'t build up sufficient protection from the standard doses of Covid-19 vaccines. Recent research also suggests that some protection from mRNA vaccines wanes for everyone over time. , Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research, told CNN he predicts that an FDA approval, plus a direct message that boosting is necessary -- even if it\'s strictly for immunocompromised people and the elderly -- will create a sort of \"booster mania\" in the US. , He said an FDA approval \"opens up everything for people who are concerned to get a doctor\'s prescription. So that just adds to the chaos.\", \'We\'re not there yet\' on boosters, Rall\'s own decision to seek out a booster was driven by all of the research he\'s read about, including data from the Israeli Health Ministry released last month that suggests that overall efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against all Covid-19 infections has dropped to just 39% in those who were vaccinated earlier in the year, although their data show the vaccine is still 91.4% effective in preventing severe disease. , Other data released by both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna suggest that both vaccines see waning levels of antibodies over time. , But that doesn\'t mean protection ends, and boosters aren\'t yet recommended for anyone., On Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN\'s Fareed Zakaria that there\'s still limited data on how long vaccine durability lasts. , \"The bottom line of it all is that we are following very carefully the durability of protection,\" Fauci said. \"And when you follow it, you look and see what is the percentage of protection that you get as you go month for month.\", When data shows protection goes below a certain threshold, he said, health officials will recommend boosters for the general population., Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\'s Hospital of Pennsylvania, said Tuesday during a conversation hosted by Brown University that he thinks \"we will cross the line, where we know we need a booster dose, when people who are vaccinated, fully vaccinated, nonetheless, are hospitalized or in the ICU or dying., \"We\'re not there yet.\", So far, the vaccines are working: A CNN analysis of CDC data suggests more than 99.9% of fully vaccinated people have not had a severe breakthrough infection., It\'s also not clear what risks could come with an additional shot. Topol says it\'s best to sit it out a few more weeks and he cautions that people who just want to go out for a booster should consider the potential side effects. , \"We don\'t know the boosters are going to protect. These boosters are directed against the original strain, the same problem we have with a vaccine,\" Topol says. \"They\'re going to raise neutralizing antibodies in people over weeks and they will help to some extent, but we don\'t know how much, because they\'re not directed to Delta.\", Rall, who recently wrote for the Wall Street Journal about his experience getting a booster shot, says he wasn\'t worried about the potential risks at all. , \"If you told me this vaccine would kill me in 10 years, I would go and take it right now because it\'s that or this horrible Delta variant going around, and I don\'t think I would survive that,\" he said., And it wasn\'t hard for him to get a booster -- Rall says the pharmacy didn\'t ask him a single question, nor did it look up his immunization records. , When asked how CVS determines whether someone who comes to one of the pharmacies or MinuteClinics to get a Covid-19 vaccine hasn\'t been vaccinated already, a spokesperson for the company said that \"patients who have been fully vaccinated at a CVS Pharmacy, or who inform us that they were fully vaccinated by another provider, will not receive another vaccine under the current CDC guidelines. In certain cases, pharmacists may also be able to check a patient\'s vaccination status with a state\'s vaccine registry.\", CVS wouldn\'t have been able to figure out Rall had already been fully vaccinated in New Jersey because immunization registries are managed by the state and he got his third shot in New York. , Rebecca Coyle, executive director of the American Immunization Registry Association, said states are currently backlogged with larger-than-normal amounts of immunization information -- and it\'s up to states to make agreements to share immunization data with each other., \"Not to point out a loophole, but we do not have good data exchange across state lines at this point,\" she said., Booster plans in progress, While some individuals are seeking out boosters, some places are making plans to boost vaccines for certain people., The city of San Francisco is accommodating people who received the one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson coronavirus vaccine and would like to receive a supplemental dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. Officials in the city\'s Department of Public Health said last week that the department is making an \"accommodation\" for those who have consulted with a physician, and it is not recommending extra doses or a policy change., In an email to CNN, Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said he believes the US will move to third mRNA and possibly second J&amp;J shots relatively soon for people having immunosuppressive therapy, especially solid organ transplant recipients, and the next question will be what other immunocompromised conditions will also be included. After, the next question will be if the US wants to add boosters for people over age 60 -- as Israel has just announced it plans to do. , Germany, the United Kingdom and France also announced booster programs for their most vulnerable populations, even though the World Health Organization last week called for a moratorium on booster shots through at least September until vaccines can be distributed more equitably worldwide. , That\'s a great irony to Rall, who says that he wouldn\'t have considered seeking out a third shot if it weren\'t clear that a lot are going unused by vaccine hesitant populations, particularly in the South., \"But even locally here in New York when I talked to local physicians and pharmacists, they all have lots of unused vaccines, and I thought, well this is ridiculous.\", Rall says since sharing his experience with others he\'s heard from physicians that say they have quietly used vaccine doses as boosters that were set to expire on themselves and for their family members, and that they\'ve been doing so for months. \"There\'s an underground there, there\'s a lot of doctors who have access to these doses, and they\'re using them rather than throwing them away.\", Those close to Rall weren\'t all that surprised by his decision to get a booster shot. \"Friends kind of know that I\'m an independent thinker, I kind of don\'t really care about or have much respect for sort of one\'s \'official conclusions\' coming from policymakers because. I know that the policymakers are trying to save as many people as possible, as low cost as possible. That\'s their job.\", \"I, first and foremost, care about me, so I have a different calculus.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/11/health/covid-19-vaccine-booster-mania/index.html',1,315),(231,'Some children\'s hospitals in Covid-19 hotspots are especially busy ','It was far from a quiet Monday for infectious disease specialist Dr. Adriana Cadilla who had to meet with patients, many of them just out of the hospital after being treated for Covid-19 at Nemours Children\'s Hospital in Orlando.\"Clinics were packed,\" Cadilla said. Her hospital has seen a significant increase in the number of children with Covid-19. They\'re also managing an earlier than usual surge in other respiratory illnesses. Kids aren\'t sicker with Covid-19, necessarily, there are just more of them, Cadilla said. , \"We know how to treat a lot of these things, including Covid,\" Cadilla said. \"But this is a public health crisis because when you overload the system, we can\'t do a lot of things well.\", It\'s frustrating, she said, because while they can provide supportive care for children, treatments like monoclonal antibodies aren\'t authorized for children under the age of 12, and neither are vaccines. , What\'s even more frustrating to her is that some families of her patients tell her that they won\'t get vaccinated, or they won\'t get everyone vaccinated until after their child has been hospitalized. , \"I saw one today who got the sibling vaccinated who was eligible, but it\'s just a hard way to learn that vaccines work by having to see a loved one hospitalized,\" Cadilla said. These hospital admissions, she said, are totally preventable.  , With school starting, Cadilla is concerned if more people don\'t get vaccinated, her hospital will get a lot busier. , \"We are trying to prepare for the unimaginable,\" Cadilla said. , Across the country, Covid-19 cases among children have been on the rise since early July after months of decline. Almost 94,000 cases among children were added in the past week, the American Academy of Pediatrics said in what the group described as a \"continuing substantial increase.\", The vast majority of cases don\'t end up in the hospital. Generally, the cumulative hospitalization rate for children with Covid-19 has remained steady at around 1% since December, according to the AAP, meaning hospitalization is still uncommon compared to the number of adults who have been hospitalized. Nearly 189,000 adults have been hospitalized since the start of the pandemic, according to the CDC. , Yet, as of Saturday, the number of children who were hospitalized increased week-over-week, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., Specifically, there was an average of 203 children with Covid-19 admitted to US hospitals every day over the past week, CDC data shows. That\'s a more than 21% increase from the previous week in daily new hospitalizations among Covid-19 patients ages 0 to 17., \"I think most areas, we are nearing or exceeding pediatric intensive care capacity,\" said Mark Wietecha, the CEO of the Children\'s Hospital Association, an association that represents more than 220 children\'s hospitals. Hot spots for child cases are pretty much everywhere the adult Covid-19 hotspots are, he said., Wietecha said hospitals are also stretched thin managing other diseases, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases, which he said this year are much higher and much more \"wicked.\" He said these hospitals have also been managing severe spikes in pediatric behavioral health or mental health cases throughout the pandemic. That will likely increase too, as it usually does, when school starts back up. , \"It\'s been quite a few things adding up that have added all this pressure on beds,\" Wietcha said. \"We don\'t have a great national surge capacity in pediatrics.\"  , \"It\'s a big problem and an immediate one.\" , As of Monday, there have also been at least 542 pediatric deaths related to Covid-19, according to the CDC. Deaths among children are still considered rare, and seven states in the US have had no reported child deaths. While that might not sound like a lot, given the more than 614,000 deaths in the US overall, the death of a child from any disease is typically incredibly rare., When asked if children really should get vaccines, CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky put these deaths in perspective in a hearing for the US Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions at the end of July., \"One thing just I want to note with the children is: I think we fall into this flawed thinking of saying that only 400 of these 600,000 deaths from COVID-19 have been in children. Children are not supposed to die, so 400 is a huge amount,\" Walensky said., \'Things are moving a little bit too quickly\', Justin Senior, the CEO of Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, which represents several children\'s hospitals in Florida, said they are seeing about a 1 to 2% overall hospitalization among pediatric patients and that\'s been pretty consistent throughout the pandemic. Nicklaus Children\'s Hospital in Miami has 24 patients, with seven in the ICU, for a total of 39 patients. At Johns Hopkins All Children\'s in the Tampa Bay area there are 15 children in the ICU. , \"These recent surges are a really dark cloud, just very, very bad,\" said Senior. \"But at the same time there are a couple of silver linings and one is that this virus -- knock on wood -- still does not seem to impact children anywhere near to the extent that it impacts adults and that\'s a good thing.\" , In the Miami area, Dr. Aileen Marty, an infectious disease expert at Florida International University said the children\'s hospitals there have been overwhelmed. , , \"Our pediatricians, the nursing, the staff are exhausted. And the children are suffering,\" Marty said. \"It is absolutely devastating ... We\'ve never seen numbers like this before.\", Experts say it\'s still not clear if the Delta variant is causing more severe disease with kids, though it is more transmissible.  , Dr. Amy Edwards, an infectious disease specialist at UH Rainbow Babies &amp; Children\'s Hospital in Cleveland, said it\'s clear from the data that Covid-19 is now sending more children to the hospital. , What\'s unclear, she said, is whether that\'s because more kids are catching the virus, or the virus is somehow making the kids who do catch it more ill than before, requiring treatment at a hospital. , \"Things are moving a little bit too quickly, and we know perfectly well that, especially with children, we\'re not testing enough to really understand exactly what\'s going on,\" she said. , Edwards said her hospital is not inundated yet, but she expects they\'ll see more cases in a few weeks. Children\'s National Hospital in Washington, D.C. may be on the same trajectory. It has seen a slight increase in children testing positive for Covid-19, but said this increase has not yet impacted much the number of hospital admissions. Lurie Children\'s Hospital of Chicago is also watching the cases closely. , \"We expect Covid-19 activity to increase over the next several weeks,\" said Dr. Larry Kociolek, the associate medical director of infection prevention and control at Lurie Children\'s Hospital of Chicago., Wietecha, with the Children\'s Hospital Association, said people need to be careful in their thinking that children have escaped Covid-19. , \"I think the idea that kids are pretty much healthy and fine is a unicorn,\" Wietecha said. , Kids are not immortal, he said, and it should be very rare that a child would ever need to go to the hospital. The fact that even a few hundred have, is too many. , \"I think a lot of parents view that their kids are kind of safe and unfortunately, we\'re finding out otherwise,\" Wietecha said.

Experts weigh in ','For young children, the pandemic comes at a crucial time for developing skills important for empathy, safety and more -- a phase that some parents worry will be impaired by mask-wearing. \"There are sensitive periods in early childhood development in which language development and emotional development are really rapidly developing for the first few years of life,\" said Ashley Ruba, a postdoctoral researcher in the University of Wisconsin-Madison\'s Child Emotion Lab. , Being able to use others\' verbal or facial cues to figure out how someone is feeling or pick up on safe or dangerous aspects of environments and people is a critical task for young kids, Ruba added. , Concerns that wearing masks might interfere with these natural learning experiences and communication skills have been studied before the pandemic. , When children ages 3 to 8 viewed faces covered with face masks, they didn\'t show any impairment in classifying the expressions, according to a 2012 study published in the journal Cognition. This suggested that children under 9 preferred studying the eyes area even when they could see full faces, the researchers wrote., During the pandemic, Ruba, too, has studied whether masks affected children\'s abilities to understand facial expressions. , Ruba and her coauthor showed more than 80 children ages 7 to 13 photos of faces that were unobstructed, covered by a surgical mask or wearing sunglasses. The faces displayed sadness, anger or fear. , When asked to assign one of six emotions to each face, the children were correct about uncovered faces 66% of the time, the researchers found. When faces were covered by masks, the children had trouble but were able to correctly identify sadness roughly 28% of the time, anger 27% and fear 18%, which was more than the odds (about 17%) of correctly guessing one emotion from the six labels. , Given these findings and children\'s innate flexibility in adapting to challenges or catching up, some experts aren\'t suspecting any long-term effects of mask-wearing on children\'s development. , \"I think once masks are gone or almost gone, whatever impact it has, we\'ll quickly recover,\" said Dr. Hugh Bases, a clinical associate professor of pediatrics at Hassenfeld Children\'s Hospital at NYU Langone Health. , If children\'s \"social and language development is a little bit slower, which it could be, balancing that with the risk of someone dying of the coronavirus -- when all the evidence we have indicates that they will catch up and they will be OK -- just doesn\'t seem worth it to me,\" said Amy Learmonth, a professor of psychology at William Paterson University in New Jersey. , \"I look at the numbers of people who have died in this country, and it\'s horrifying.\" , Differences among ages and learning styles , From birth, babies learn how to communicate by observing their loved ones\' faces, mouths and voices and trying to respond, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.  , \"What your 6-year-old is learning is about things like sarcasm and meaning. What your 1-year-old is learning is, like, that thing with four legs that runs around the house is called \'dog,\' \" Learmonth said. , The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn\'t recommended that children younger than 2 wear masks. For children younger than 18 months, learning how to communicate through visual cues is \"probably more important because learning a new word when you don\'t have any is complicated,\" Learmonth added.  , If you\'re worried about your child\'s lingual and social development during the pandemic, just ensure you set aside time to talk with your child face-to-face when you\'re at home and not wearing a mask, Learmonth suggested. , \"For most of our kids, as long as they\'re getting interaction with their parents in the morning and in the evening, they\'re going to be OK.\" These interactions could be during baths, playtime or meals. , Additionally, \"conversation often is more than just the actual verbal content,\" Bases said. , Other elements such as vocal inflection or physical gestures not obscured by masks can add to the context that helps children develop communication skills. Young children, including those who are visually impaired, will use other clues or senses to understand and learn language, according to AAP., One concern, however, is for kids whose lingual or social development is atypical, Learmonth said. , \"Anyone who is just a little behind in language development or a little behind in understanding social cues -- what concerns me is that they will fall further behind,\" she added. , \"Because unlike a typically developing child who is probably all right with only four or five hours of full-face interaction a day, a child who\'s struggling is going to need all they can get and more,\" Learmonth said.  , When parents can help , To better communicate with a child while wearing a mask, the AAP recommends adults get the child\'s attention before speaking, face the child directly with no physical or noise barriers in the way and speak slowly and louder, but not shouting, if needed. , You can add contextual information to your words by using your hands, body language and tone of voice. Depending on the response, ask whether your child understood and repeat yourself if necessary. , If you have concerns about your child\'s language development skills now or later, seek evaluation from certified speech-language pathologists. Some of them are still practicing in-person while wearing clear masks or virtually, according to the AAP. , \"As speech-language pathologists working with children with communication disorders, our transition to the new normal of communicating with face masks was quick and smooth,\" wrote India-based speech-language pathologists Divya Swaminathan and Shoba Meera in an October 2020 article. , The \"greater good\" of protecting one another, teachers and families \"far outweighs the potential theoretical issue that might come up as a result of wearing face masks,\" Bases said., \"Kids adjust, they adapt, and when they don\'t have to wear them, they\'ll adapt again. ... It\'s a very fluid, dynamic kind of learning. And development is obviously not linear. There\'s ups and downs, even in days before face masks.\" , Another encouragement is that children living in cultures where face coverings are the norm still learn to communicate, Learmonth said. \"There are lots of ways across the world to speak to small children, and they all work.\" ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/11/health/masks-child-development-effects-covid-pandemic-wellness/index.html',1,317),(233,'One month later: These maps show how quickly Covid engulfed the US again','More than 98% of US residents now live in an area where there is a \"high\" or \"substantial\" risk of The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) measures community transmission using two metrics -- the number of cases per 100,000 people and the test positivity rate, both measured over the previous seven days. , The latest figures from the CDC show an alarming rise in the number of counties that are considered at high risk of community transmission. On Monday, 2,361 counties in the United States were listed in the \"high\" tier, a stark increase from 457 counties in the same tier at the beginning of July. A look at the past five weeks shows just how rapidly community transmission has increased across the country., , An area with a low transmission rate has 10 or fewer cases per 100,000 people and a positivity rate below 5%, while an area with a high transmission rate has 100 or more cases per 100,000 people and a positivity rate of 10% or higher. , The increase in community transmission has led to renewed mask mandates and an urgent push for vaccinations across the country, especially in areas where vaccination rates are low. The CDC now recommends that people wear masks indoors if they are in areas with \"substantial\" or \"high\" levels of spread, regardless of whether or not they are vaccinated. You can look up your county\'s transmission level on the CDC\'s website, which updates multiple times per week., Vaccines are the most effective tool in combating the spread of the new Delta variant, according to available data, with studies indicating that all three commonly available vaccines are able to prevent severe illness or death from Covid-19. , , Read more:, Track US Covid-19 cases where you live, How many people are vaccinated in your state, , ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/11/health/one-month-later-these-maps-show-how-quickly-covid-engulfed-the-us-again/index.html',1,318),(234,'CDC strengthens recommendation for pregnant women to get vaccinated against Covid-19','The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated itsPreviously, the public health agency was vague in its recommendation. \"If you are pregnant, you can receive a Covid-19 vaccine,\" previous guidance read.  Now, the CDC is strengthening its guidance, recommending that pregnant women should be vaccinated against Covid-19, based on new data about the safety of the vaccines., , \"COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all people 12 years and older, including people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future,\" the new guidance reads., \"Evidence about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy has been growing. These data suggest that the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy,\" the CDC adds in the updated guidance on its website., \"We are not seeing a signal of safety concerns of the vaccine in pregnancy,\" Sascha Ellington, team lead for emergency preparedness and response in the CDC\'s Division of Reproductive Health, told CNN on Wednesday., Pregnant women are at an increased risk of getting severely ill from Covid-19 and \"adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth,\" Ellington said. \"This vaccine can prevent Covid-19, and so that\'s the primary benefit.\", The agency said Wednesday that a new analysis of information from its V-SAFE database, used to track vaccine side effects and safety, found no increased risk for miscarriage among people who received either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna coronavirus vaccines before 20 weeks of pregnancy. There were also no safety concerns among people who were vaccinated late in pregnancy -- for themselves or for their babies., The rate of miscarriage among vaccinated pregnant women was about 13%, which is consistent with the rate that would be expected among unvaccinated pregnant women, Ellington said. In response to the myth that the vaccine could cause fertility issues, she said, \"There are no data to indicate that the vaccine has any effect on fertility.\", , The website reflects this, also. \"There is currently no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems in women or men,\" it says., The CDC says that it recommends Covid-19 vaccination for everyone ages 12 and older, including those who may be pregnant, breastfeeding, or who are trying to get pregnant. , As of July 31, only around 23% of pregnant women in the United States have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, Ellington said. \"The vaccine coverage of 23% does give us an indication that it is below where we want it to be,\" she added., In late July, two leading organizations that represent obstetricians and gynecologists recommended that anyone who is pregnant should be vaccinated against Covid-19. The groups had previously said Covid-19 vaccines \"should not be withheld\" from someone because they are pregnant, but did not specifically recommend they get one. , , The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) said their recommendations were based on safety evidence from thousands of pregnant women., The associations also cite the country\'s low vaccination rate and the recent increase in cases., The two groups urge their members to \"enthusiastically recommend vaccination\" to their patients.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/11/health/cdc-recommends-covid-19-vaccine-pregnant-women-wellness/index.html',1,319),(235,'Remote work made life easier for many people with disabilities. They want the option to stay','Gabe Moses prefers to work his eight-hour shift for a call center while lying on his stomach, resting on a mattress set out on the floor of his apartment. Moses uses a wheelchair because of conditions including dysautonomia, which arises from a dysfunctional nervous system and can affect major organs, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. A connective tissue disorder, EDS can cause chronic pain, muscle weakness and ruptured blood vessels. , Before the pandemic, commuting to work and sitting up for hours at a time left Moses in pain and so fatigued, he sometimes lost his ability to speak. But when he started working remotely while lying down, he discovered his job was easier. He had energy at the end of the day to spend time with his wife, watch movies, read books or even take his dog for a walk by tying her leash to his wheelchair., At the beginning of the pandemic, Moses said his company made him sign a document that claimed it only offered remote work as an emergency measure, and that it could call him back in person at any time. , Now, as the US continues its uneven reopening and some companies expect employees to return to offices, Moses, who lives in an apartment in New York City, worries the option will be taken away., \"It\'s really terrifying to think about going back to that life,\" Moses told CNN. \"Coming back (from work), I would just go right to bed.\" , Accessibility is not one-size-fits-all, In the United States, 26% of adults have some kind of disability, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For many, remote work has been more accessible as offices often lack situation-specific accommodations., These can include wheelchair ramps and certain types of accommodating furniture, safety from allergens, and easy access to medications and bathrooms.  , The National Organization on Disability supports flexible work policies above all, said Charles Catherine, associate director of special projects for the organization. , \"There will be companies where people will have very little choice, and there will be a lot of peer pressure,\" Catherine said. \"And there will be other companies for which work culture is a top priority, where there will be more leeway. And so the question is, do you want to be an employer of choice?\" , Catherine, who is blind, said he was frustrated at the pandemic\'s start because digital accommodations such as closed captioning for online meetings and software that read text out loud were rare. Many companies improved software accessibility over the course of the last year and a half, and Catherine now prefers working from home. But what he went through underscores the varied experiences of workers with disabilities. Working from home may benefit some, but it isn\'t a one-size-fits-all solution. , Not to mention, there are plenty of jobs that can\'t be done remotely. Those who couldn\'t work from home have had to spend the last year and a half battling an impossible choice: risking their life by going into work, or not working at all. Others have seen their jobs eliminated altogether., In 2020, 17.9% of people with disabilities were employed, down from 19.3% in 2019, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, the rate of unemployed in this vulnerable demographic actively looking for jobs increased by about 5 percentage points. , \"It just continues to show how disposable our system thinks disabled people are, because we\'re not contributing to capitalism in the way that people who have more working capability are. But it doesn\'t have to be that way,\" Moses said. \"If the government wanted to just take care of people, so that working wasn\'t something they did out of desperation, then they could.\", The community has requested remote work options for years, For many in the community, the sudden availability of remote options has been bittersweet, said Shelby Hintze, a producer for a local news station in Salt Lake City. , Hintze uses a wheelchair because of her spinal muscular atrophy., \"One of the hardest things for me during this whole time has been seeing something that disabled people have been asking for for so long and told it\'s not possible -- all of a sudden, when everybody else needs it, we move heaven and earth to make it happen,\" Hintze told CNN. , For people with conditions that affect their immune systems, Hintze said remote work can alleviate their ongoing risk from Covid-19. Hintze has followed a strict lockdown because she\'s at high risk from respiratory diseases like Covid-19, and her company allowed her to work from home without objection., Even as Covid-19 vaccines allow some to return to a more normal way of life, people with compromised immune systems may not even be fully protected by the vaccine. Data from the CDC revealed the response to the vaccines might be reduced for several high-risk groups., \"People say, \'There are these immunocompromised people we have to do all these hard things to take care of,\' instead of saying, \'Wow, your hard life has now been made harder (by the pandemic),\'\" Hintze said. , Normalizing remote work could help initiate long-term change, Joanna Hanaka also advocates for disability rights on social media and has multiple conditions that make her highly allergic to fragrances. Working from home makes it easier to control her environment, and she has much more energy from not being exposed to allergens, she said., Hanaka believes companies have seen the benefits of work-from-home arrangements., \"So many people have now experienced the benefits of remote work, such as the time and money saved since they don\'t have to commute,\" Hanaka said. \"Since I\'ve begun working from home, I don\'t feel so drained by the end of the work day.\", Working from home has had other unexpected benefits. Catherine said people have more control over disclosing their disabilities to bosses and coworkers. , \"Everywhere I go, my cane discloses my disability for me,\" Catherine said. \"But if I met someone on the phone, or on Zoom, I choose to disclose my disability or not and people can\'t tell. if I were interviewing (for a job), I don\'t know how it would affect the decision on either side. But certainly, I\'d have more cards in my hand.\" , Moses theorizes the next few months could represent a turning point for accessibility. Or, it could be a missed opportunity. Companies could continue to enforce standards that put people with disabilities at a disadvantage, he said. Or, they could normalize accommodations for these folks that have been previously considered emergency-only measures. , \"They\'ve proven for the past year and a half that we can do this just as well from home as we could ever do it from an office,\" Moses said. \"I know there are some people that still go there because they don\'t have the ability to work at home. I understand the office being there for people that need it. But there\'s not any reason that people that want to work remotely can\'t. It would be safer for everyone.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/10/health/remote-work-disabilities-pandemic-wellness-trnd/index.html',1,320),(236,'Covid-19 or the common cold? How to tell if your child contracted Covid-19 as school starts','Common colds share many symptoms of the coronavirus, so if your child becomes ill as the school year gets underway, it might be difficult to immediately tell whether it\'s Covid-19, said CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen.Adults catch the common cold around two to three times a year, and children get it even more frequently, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. , Most people recover in seven to 10 days from the cold, but it can take longer if they have weakened immune systems, the CDC noted., Some shared symptoms of Covid-19 and the common cold include a sore throat, fatigue and a headache, according to Wen. , Coughing is another common symptom of both viruses, although according to the Mayo Clinic, the Covid-19 cough tends to be drier. , , When children contract Covid-19, they tend to have milder symptoms than adults, Wen added., \"I would encourage parents to have a high index of suspicion and to definitely not send your child to school if they are not feeling themselves and have any symptoms that could be Covid-19,\" she said., Symptoms specific to Covid-19 include loss of smell or taste, Wen said., , With some severe common cold cases, someone could lose their sense of smell or taste due to nasal congestion, she explained. However, with Covid-19 you often lose your sense of smell or taste early and prior to nasal congestion, Wen added., People who\'ve contracted Covid-19 may also suffer from diarrhea and nausea or vomiting, symptoms that are never present if it\'s only the common cold, according to the Mayo Clinic. , Covid-19 and the common cold are also caused by different viruses. Covid-19 is contracted from SARS-CoV-2, while the common cold can result from rhinoviruses, the Mayo Clinic noted., Get your child tested, If you suspect your child has Covid-19, the most important thing is to not send them to school, Wen cautioned. , \"I\'m sure no parent would want to have other kids in the class become infected or their classmates\' family members, or for the class to have to shut down because their child is symptomatic and may have spread it to others,\" Wen said., , The next step Wen recommended is to get your child tested for Covid-19. , Testing is much more readily available than it was a year ago, she said, and parents should contact their pediatricians for options., Wen said she expects Covid-19 testing options to be localized, meaning the best places to get tested change depending on where you live. In some instances, local clinics may have availability, or children can go to testing sites run by their county health department., Avoid the doctors for mild symptoms, For children with mild Covid-19 symptoms, Wen recommended parents think twice before heading to the doctor. , \"If you have mild symptoms, if it\'s Covid or any other viral illnesses, you should not be going into a doctor\'s office unless you have talked to your pediatrician and they are requesting that you come in,\" Wen said. , If you are symptomatic, Wen said, you could transmit it to someone else by going in. , , Get your child vaccinated, Children 12 and older are eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine, and Wen recommended parents take their kids to get vaccinated immediately., It takes two doses plus two weeks before the two-dose vaccines offer maximum protection., For parents, getting kids vaccinated is \"the best way of preventing their adolescent from contracting Covid-19 on the front end and potentially missing school and other social activities with their friends,\" Wen said., ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/09/health/coronavirus-common-cold-differences-children-wellness/index.html',1,321),(237,'2 Texas ERs temporarily shut down as US Covid-19 hospitalization and death rates double in 2 weeks','The Hunt Regional Medical Center at Commerce said its ER is temporarily closing \"due to a critical Covid surge.\" , Those suffering a medical emergency should \"proceed to the nearest emergency room in Greenville or Quinlan,\" the hospital said. , Texas Health Hospital in Rockwall said in its temporary ER closure would allow medical staff to transfer to the hospital\'s main campus, where they \"will provide care related to the pandemic,\" according to the hospital\'s website., The US is now averaging more than 108,000 Covid-19 cases per day over the past week -- the highest in about six months, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. , Rates of hospitalizations and deaths have almost doubled in the past two weeks. More than 67,000 people are hospitalized with Covid-19, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services. , In Florida, the hospitalization rate is more than triple the national rate. There are more than 65 people hospitalized with Covid-19 for every 100,000 people in Florida, about one out of every 1,500 state residents. Throughout the United States, about 21 people are hospitalized with Covid-19 for every 100,000 people. , In Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, hospitalization rates are more than double the national number. , Arkansas Gov.  Asa Hutchinson said Monday that hospitalizations for Covid-19 are at an all-time high and there are only eight available intensive care unit beds in the state., And every day, about 514 Americans are dying from Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins. , The vast majority of Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths are among those not fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., More than 99.99% of people who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 have not had a breakthrough case resulting in hospitalization or death, a CNN analysis of new CDC data suggests. , As of August 2, more than 164 million people in the US were fully vaccinated, according to CDC data. Fewer than 0.005% of those vaccinated -- or 7,101 people -- were hospitalized with Covid-19, and less than 0.001% of them -- 1,507 people -- died from Covid-19. , About 74% of reported breakthrough infections were among seniors ages 65 or older, according to the CDC., GOP governor: \'Run to the fire and get vaccinated\', With all the data and knowledge, \'You\'re taking a hell of a risk if you\'re not vaccinated,\" West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Monday. , \"I don\'t know why in the world we would not run ... to get our kids vaccinated,\" the governor said, referring to those ages 12 and older, the youngest age group eligible for the vaccine., \"And I don\'t know why in the world if you\'re not vaccinated yourself, you wouldn\'t be running today, right this moment, to get vaccinated with all this information that\'s out there in front of you.\", Justice said he doesn\'t want to issue a mask mandate, but might have to do so if the crisis gets worse.  , \"We\'re on a collision course here,\" the Republican governor said. , \"I am telling you as your governor, as your friend, as the person that you really trusted: Right now, you need to put this as a No. 1 priority in your life and run to the fire and get vaccinated.\", Most of the US has \'high\' or \'substantial\' transmission, More than 98% of the US population lives in a county where people should now be wearing a mask in indoor public places, according to guidance from the CDC., Those in counties with \"high\" or \"substantial\" coronavirus transmission should mask up indoors, the CDC said. , \"We\'re seeing severely increasing rates\" of new infections, said Michael Sweat, team leader of the Covid-19 Epidemiology Intelligence Project at the Medical University of South Carolina. , \"In early July, we were down to the lowest we\'ve been since the beginning (of the pandemic),\" he said. , \"Now, just within a couple of weeks, we are getting close to the maximum number of cases we\'ve had from the beginning.\", Of those getting hospitalized, more than 90% are not vaccinated -- mirroring national statistics from the CDC. , \"But we\'re also seeing younger patients than we have seen in the past,\" Sweat said. , \"I believe this is largely because vaccination rates were quite high among people 60 and over. But we are seeing many teens. We\'re seeing some pediatric cases. So it is shifting from what we\'ve seen before.\", Get vaccinated before another variant arises, Fauci says, The longer a virus spreads and replicates among unvaccinated people, the more chances it has to mutate. , And when mutations give the virus an advantage, more aggressive variants can emerge -- such as ones that could evade vaccines. , \"Then all of us who are protected against Delta may not be protected against\" some other variant, Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a Q&amp;A with USA Today published Sunday., If an overwhelming majority of the population is vaccinated, the virus will disappear in the country, said the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases., But having only a partially vaccinated population means smoldering levels of infection will carry into the fall, Fauci told USA Today. Then Covid-19 infections could be confused with the flu this winter and pick back up in the spring., And if the rest of the world isn\'t vaccinated over the next couple of years, more circulation could mean more variants, Fauci warned., In many parts of the country, particularly the South, hospitalizations are surging. Louisiana set a new record for Covid-19 hospitalizations last week. Florida\'s hospitalizations recently jumped 13% over the previous peak in 2020. And a hospital in Houston said Sunday morning there are no more beds left in the facility., \"Over the last 12 hours, we have lost more patients than ... in the last five to six weeks,\" Houston\'s United Memorial Medical Center Chief of Staff Dr. Joseph Varon said., Experts not worried about vaccine protection yet, While some have questioned the risk of the emerging Lambda (C.37) variant, researchers aren\'t yet seriously concerned about current vaccines not working against the Lambda nor Delta variants, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told ABC on Sunday., \"We all worry about the day when a variant arrives that the vaccines stop working as well,\" Collins said. \"The best way to reduce that from happening is to reduce the number of infections. That\'s how variants happen. , \"All the more reason why we should be doing everything possible to cut back the wild spread of Delta so we don\'t get something even more dangerous.\", But public health officials are watching vaccine efficacy closely, including how protection might wane over time, Fauci told CNN. , When data shows protection goes below a certain threshold, health officials will recommend boosters for the general population, Fauci said Sunday. , Pfizer has said its Covid-19 vaccine appears to stay 84% effective after six months. , Moderna said last week its Covid-19 vaccine showed 93% efficacy against symptomatic disease through six months., Boosters could come too late for immunocompromised people, Concerns over vaccine protection are different for people who are immunocompromised, have had a transplant or are undergoing cancer therapy. , \"We know for sure that they never did get an adequate response -- most of them, not all of them, but most of them,\" Fauci said. , \"We need to look at them in a different light than the durability for a normal person, which means that we will almost certainly be boosting those people before we boost the general population that\'s been vaccinated.\" , Research published in JAMA Network Open estimates that 6 million people in the US are taking immunosuppressants that could interfere with the vaccine -- a number the researchers say is likely an underestimate., The FDA is moving quickly to decide on Covid-19 vaccine boosters for people with compromised immune systems, and a decision could come sometime before early September, a Biden administration official told CNN. , Even if the decision comes soon, it may not be soon enough for people who are immunocompromised amid the spread of the Delta variant, according to Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the FDA., \"Because by the time you actually make that decision ... and you start operationalizing a booster campaign, you\'re talking about maybe late October if the decision comes in September, that you can start getting a sizeable number of people boosted,\" Gottlieb told CBS on Sunday. , \"It takes time to get that stood up and get people into the doctors\' offices to get injections. And it will take a couple of weeks for the immunity to mature.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/09/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html',1,323),(238,'Youth depression and anxiety doubled during the pandemic, new analysis finds','The kids are not all right, a new analysis suggests.During the Covid-19 pandemic, depression and anxiety in youth doubled compared to pre-pandemic levels, according to the research. One in 4 adolescents globally are \"experiencing clinically elevated depression symptoms, while 1 in 5 youth are experiencing clinically elevated anxiety symptoms.\", \"Results from this analysis suggest that the pandemic has likely instigated a global mental health crisis in youth,\" said study author Sheri Madigan, an associate professor of clinical psychology and Canada research chair in determinants of child development at the University of Calgary., As the months went by, these negative impacts on youth only got worse, the study found. This surprised Madigan, who said she thought \"they would be more resilient and malleable to the challenges of the pandemic\" as it persisted. , This cumulative toll could be due to the persistent social isolation, missed milestones, family financial problems and extended school disruptions, according to the analysis. Further studies following children for a longer period of time should be conducted, the study noted, to monitor the ongoing effects. , , The meta-analysis, published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics, reviewed 29 studies with a total of more than 80,000 participants globally, ranging from age 4 to 17 with a mean age of 13. The included studies, which used empirical clinical data on depression and anxiety, were conducted in East Asia, Europe, North America, the Middle East, and Central and South America. , \'Extraordinary disruption and stress\', Youth mental health had already been declining prior to the pandemic. More than 1 in 3 high school students reported having persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness in 2019, a 40% increase from 2009, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. , The pandemic created conditions that might have exacerbated these negative feelings. With school closures and remote learning, children experienced the loss of peer interactions, greater social isolation, and less interaction with other supportive adults like teachers and coaches. These changes may have contributed to increased symptoms of depression, such as feelings of sadness, loss of interest in activities, and disruption to appetite and sleep, according to the study. , Additionally, the general uncertainty and disruptions of daily routines caused by the pandemic likely increased symptoms of generalized anxiety in youth, including fear, uncontrollable worry and hyperarousal, the study noted. Worry for the health of family and friends as Covid-19 spread also likely contributed to children\'s heightened anxiety, according to the research., , \"Children and youth have experienced extraordinary disruption and stress during the pandemic, and it\'s taken a toll on their mental health,\" Madigan said. \"When mental health problems persist and aren\'t properly addressed, they can have lasting consequences.\", The study\'s findings are consistent with what Jenna Glover, a child clinical psychologist and director of psychology training at Children\'s Hospital Colorado, said she is seeing on the ground. She was not involved in the study., \"The disruption to their routines and consistency is very damaging for a child\'s mental health,\" Glover said. \"They thrive on predictability, which has been absent for over a year.\", The chronic stress and instability children are experiencing can lead to feelings of hopelessness, which is one of the top predictors of suicide ideation, she added., In addition to the general increase in youth mental illness, the study also found that older children were impacted more severely than younger ones, possibly due to puberty and hormonal changes on top of the loss of social interaction. , , Girls showed greater prevalence of depression and anxiety, too, which, according to the study, is in line with research prior to the pandemic. While this is a well-known phenomenon, it often gets glossed over in conversations about mental health, Glover said., \"This is not good for youth, but it is especially bad for females,\" she said. \"Thinking about real targeted interventions and screenings based on knowing those things I think is an important takeaway from this study.\" , How to move forward, Researchers should continue to monitor the youth mental health situation as the pandemic continues and examine ways to address this crisis, Madigan said., \"This is a critical time. When we talk about children and youth being the future of our societies, this couldn\'t be more real or truthful,\" Madigan said. \"If youth grow through this pandemic with increasing levels of stress and mental health challenges, society could be in for some real challenges as youth age into adulthood.\", , Keeping regular routines is integral to young people\'s well-being, emphasized Brae Anne McArthur, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Calgary and a clinical child psychologist who was also involved in the study. , \"Knowing that children and youth thrive in the context of clear routines, it is important that children and youth remain in school and extracurricular activities,\" McArthur said., That\'s why schools should be kept open as much as safely possible, Madigan said. , \"Schools can be a refuge for many youths, but also, up to 80% of youth rely on school-based services and resources to address their mental health needs,\" she said. \"If schools are closed, many youths who need help may feel they have nowhere to turn to get it, which could have drastic consequences.\", , Glover echoed that schools should be kept open to the extent possible. Parents also can take action by checking in with their kids and monitoring their sleeping and eating habits as well as their mood, she said.  , McArthur said although the situation is dire, we still have time to turn it around. , \"It (the study) does not suggest that we cannot recover from this mental health crisis,\" she said. \"If we can come together as parents, researchers, clinicians and policy-makers to develop clear and actionable ways to move forward to support child and youth mental health, we can re-write this story in another year\'s time.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/10/health/covid-child-teen-depression-anxiety-wellness/index.html',1,324),(239,'FDA approval of the Covid-19 vaccine could mean more people will get vaccinated for an unexpected reason','Pfizer\'s Covid-19 vaccine is currently only authorized for emergency use in the United States, but its full approval by the US Food and Drug Administration could The ramifications could alter the course of the pandemic in several ways., , First, full approval of a Covid-19 vaccine could persuade more people to get vaccinated., More than 30% of the eligible population in the United States still hasn\'t gotten a vaccine., To qualify for emergency use authorization, Covid-19 vaccine makers submitted about three months of clinical trial data. This included at least 2 months of safety data on fully vaccinated participants, since most vaccine side effects occur 2-3 months after the vaccination., For some Americans, that hasn\'t been enough data to convince them to get the shot., Full approval of a Covid-19 vaccine requires much more data, including safety and efficacy data generated in the real-world, outside of a clinical trial. The CDC has been tracking real-world data on the vaccines and more than 165 million people in the US are now vaccinated against the virus., The extra data may help convince more people that the vaccines are not dangerous., \"For some, getting a full FDA approval will help allay that fear. Even if it\'s just a relatively small number of people. Every little bit helps against this virus,\" Dr. David Dowdy, an associate professor in the division of infectious disease epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said., Three in ten unvaccinated adults said they would be more likely to get vaccinated if one of the vaccines moves to full approval, according to a survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. , However, Kaiser cautioned that some people it surveyed were confused about the shots. Two-thirds thought the vaccines already had full approval or they were unsure about it. This finding may just mean that full approval \"is a proxy for general safety concerns.\" , Dr. Michael Wolf, the associate vice chair for Research, Department of Medicine at Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine expects approval would get about 5-10% more individuals worried about safety to get vaccinated. , The FDA is currently \"working around the clock\" on approval of the Covid-19 vaccine, according to Dr. Paul Offit, a prominent member of the FDA\'s vaccine advisory committee and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia., \"I think from the standpoint of the public, it really shouldn\'t matter,\" Offit said. \"It\'s been given to half of the American population. We have more than 300 million doses out there. This is far from experimental. We have a tremendous safety and efficacy portfolio on these vaccines -- I mean, it\'s more than most licensed products that are out there now.\", And yet he recognized that, at least for some, it does matter. He said the FDA knows that, too., \"I think they realize that at least there\'s a psychological issue with how these vaccines are viewed, in terms of whether they\'re a licensed product or just approved through EUA,\" Offit said., \'Carrots\' and \'sticks\' will encourage vaccination, Full approval of a Covid-19 vaccine could also make workplace mandates easier. Many unvaccinated people would face a financial reason to get one; they\'ll need it to keep their jobs., \"FDA approval alone is not going to make many individuals run out and get it now, but you\'re going to start seeing health systems and employers feel more emboldened to require them,\" Wolf said. \"There\'s precedent for mandatory vaccinations and immunizations.\", Workplaces already have the legal authority to mandate the Covid-19 vaccine,  according to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. But full approval could give any legal challenge less potency., , \"FDA approval is the gold standard. The world\'s regulators look to our FDA as the beacon when it comes to such issues as this,\" George Karavetsos, a legal expert who had worked at the FDA and now provides strategic advice to FDA regulated companies as an attorney at Buchanan Ingersoll Rooney, said. \"I can assure you, they\'re going to make sure they got this right.\", Erik Nisbet, the Owen L. Coon endowed professor of policy analysis and communication and director of the Center for Communication &amp; Public Policy in the School of Communication at Northwestern University, agreed., \"If you ever want to get beyond 70% threshold of people who have gotten a vaccination so far, you need to have carrots and you have to have sticks,\" Nisbet said. \"The only way to do that is the mandate. Authorization takes out one of the impediments to more widespread mandates.\", A little political cover, Full approval may also provide political cover to get more people vaccinated. On Wednesday, Louisiana\'s Governor John Bel Edwards said he would not consider requiring the vaccine for state employees \"unless and until the FDA grants full licensure to one of more of the Covid vaccines.\" The state has the highest per capita number of cases of any state and one of the lowest vaccination rates., San Francisco announced that it would require all city employees to be vaccinated no later than 10 weeks after FDA full approval. , Full approval may even be able to override laws like the one in Ohio that bans vaccine mandates under emergency use authorization, according to Nisbet. , \"Approval kicks that out of the way,\" he said., A potential booster bonus? , Full approval may also mean that the fully vaccinated could get an additional vaccine, even before boosters are approved. , \"Approval will make it easier for physicians to give the vaccine off label,\" Dowdy explained. \"If people can convince their doctor they need one.\", Many scientists hope people won\'t do that. While a number of clinical trials are underway, boosters are not yet recommended by the FDA and the CDC. , , Trials have shown immunocompromised people may not respond as well to the vaccines and may need a booster. There is an effort to make boosters for that population available \"very soon,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institutes for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said on Tuesday. , \"Right now, what we really want to do is get the patient population here in the US to at least get one shot and not get ahead of the data,\" said Melissa Tice, program director of regulatory affairs and assistant professor of clinical research and leadership at George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences. \"Hopefully, approval will at least get more people to get their first dose.\", What does approval mean for kids?, It remains unclear how having a fully licensed coronavirus vaccine may impact the timeline of authorizing or approving the coronavirus vaccines for children younger than 12 -- if at all, Offit said., The Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is currently authorized for ages 12 and older, whereas the Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines are authorized only for adults 18 and older., , \"Does getting full approval for an adult vaccine, does that matter in terms of speeding up the process for approval for the childhood vaccines? I think the answer to that question is probably no,\" Offit told CNN on Friday., Overall, \"this is all sort of new territory -- the notion of emergency use authorization obviously is new, certainly for vaccines that have been used to this extent. We had EUAs for anthrax vaccines, but that\'s not this,\" he said. \"I\'m not sure how the FDA views this.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/09/health/covid-19-fda-approval-meaning/index.html',1,325),(240,'Nearly 1,500 health systems across the United States mandate Covid-19 vaccination','Hospitals coast to coast are demanding their employees get vaccinated against covid as the highly contagious delta variant tears through populations with low vaccination rates.Nearly 1,500 hospitals — roughly a quarter of all hospitals in the U.S. —now require staffers to get a covid vaccine, said Colin Milligan, a spokesperson for the American Hospital Association. More follow suit every day as hospital leaders aim to head off staff shortages like those experienced last year and to keep employees from becoming vectors of the disease., But that\'s not an option in Montana, where a law passed this year amid a pandemic backlash prohibits employers, including most health care facilities, from mandating any vaccine for their staffs. Nor is it in Oregon, where a 32-year-old law similarly bans vaccine mandates for health workers., \'I cannot imagine passing any worse law than that\', At least seven states have enacted laws to prevent covid vaccine mandates or so-called vaccine passports that would provide proof of vaccination, according to the National Academy for State Health Policy. Most restrict only state and local governments or specifically exempt health care facilities, but Montana\'s law goes further. It prohibits employers — including hospitals — from discriminating against a worker based on vaccination status. Employers can\'t require vaccinations and workers don\'t have to tell their bosses whether they\'re vaccinated., That worries hospital leaders as covid hospitalizations hit levels not seen nationally since February. In Montana, covid hospitalizations had nearly doubled at the beginning of August compared with two weeks before, and about 90% of covid patients hospitalized at the end of July hadn\'t been vaccinated, according to the Montana health department\'s most recent data., \"I cannot imagine passing any worse law than that,\" said John Goodnow, CEO of Benefis Health in Great Falls. \"Imagine if that would have been passed back when we were fighting polio, or smallpox before that.\", Benefis had announced plans to make the vaccine mandatory for its 3,400 staffers back in April, before state lawmakers passed the bill preventing the hospital from doing so., Those who back the law said it\'s an issue of personal rights., \"Your health care decisions are private, they\'re protected by the constitution of the state of Montana,\" Rep. Jennifer Carlson, a Republican, said in March as she introduced the bill. \"And your religious rights are protected.\", Health care professionals are more likely to be vaccinated against covid than the general population. Nonetheless, there remain nurses, doctors and other hospital employees who work directly with patients who are hesitant or resistant to inoculation, especially in rural regions., Dr. Greg Tierney, chief medical officer of Benefis, said he\'s concerned about potential rancor between vaccinated and unvaccinated staff members as their workload rises with the caseload., \"You have the people who have been vaccinated looking at the person next to him who\'s choosing not to,\" Tierney said. \"Whereas, they were literally brethren in arms.\", No vaccine mandates increases staff shortages, In northwestern Montana, a region with a 34% vaccination rate to date and the epicenter of the state\'s latest surge, Logan Health officials said existing staffing shortages are worsening as health care workers become infected or must quarantine. Chief medical officer Dr. Doug Nelson said the shots have been proven safe and effective, and Logan would likely consider a staff vaccine mandate if state law allowed it., \"Wearing a mask whenever you\'re in our facilities, that helps, but being able to vaccinate everyone would help more,\" Nelson said., In Billings, Montana\'s most populated city, the Billings Clinic\'s intensive care unit reached capacity the first week of August and officials started shifting patients to overflow beds. At that time, roughly 60% of the system\'s employees reported being vaccinated., Hospital leaders are hosting weekly town halls to answer clinic workers\' vaccine questions or try to dispel myths in between caring for a growing number of covid patients., \"Knowing there are solutions out there that can help prevent this from happening, like simple vaccination, makes you frustrated,\" said Dr. Fernando Caceres, an intensivist in Billings Clinic\'s ICU., In July, nearly 60 major U.S. medical organizations called for employers to mandate all health and long-term care workers get vaccinated in a joint statement that included the American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association. The Department of Veterans Affairs gave health care personnel eight weeks to get the shot., In August, California became the first state to order workers in health care settings to be fully vaccinated and for visitors in health settings to show proof of vaccination or a negative covid test. And in Massachusetts, Republican Gov. Charlie Baker ordered most nursing home workers to get the jab by October 10, citing a massive increase in cases among staffers and residents., In some states, no vaccine means no job, Some hospitals have had to enforce their mandates. In Texas in June, Houston Methodist fired or accepted the resignations of more than 150 health care workers who didn\'t get the jab., Trinity Health — a Catholic health system with 117,000 workers across 22 states — said employees without a shot or exemption would be fired., \"Trinity Health has counted our own colleagues and patients in the too-high coronavirus death toll,\" Mike Slubowski, the organization\'s president and CEO, said in the announcement. \"Now that we have a proven way to prevent covid-19 deaths, we are not hesitating to do our part.\", How Trinity\'s policy will work in Oregon, where the three-decade-old law prevents vaccine requirements, is unclear, Attempts to change the law won\'t happen before next year\'s legislative session, Democratic Gov. Kate Brown said. In the meantime, she issued a rule last week to pressure health care workers to get vaccinated, saying they will face weekly covid tests if they don\'t — and their employers will foot the bill., \"This new safety measure is necessary to stop delta from causing severe illness among our first line of defense: our doctors, nurses, medical students and frontline health care workers,\" Brown said in the statement. Before Brown\'s announcement, Kaiser Permanente, a national health system based in California, had said all of its employees must be vaccinated against covid — even those in Oregon. (KHN, which produces California Healthline, is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.), After Brown\'s announcement, KP spokesperson Michael Foley said those who don\'t get the vaccine in Oregon will undergo weekly testing; employees in other states, however, will have to apply for medical or religious exemptions or find a new job if they refuse to be vaccinated.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/09/health/us-hospitals-demand-workers-vaccinated-partner/index.html',1,329),(241,'Officials split on masking children in schools as pediatric hospitals fill up with Covid-19 patients','The polarization surrounding In Florida, which has the second-highest rate of new cases per capita after Louisiana, children\'s hospitals and staff are \"overwhelmed,\" said Dr. Aileen Marty, an infectious disease expert at Florida International University. , \"The numbers of cases in our hospitals in children and our children\'s hospitals are completely overwhelmed,\" Marty told CNN\'s Jim Sciutto on Friday evening., \"Our pediatricians, the nursing, the staff are exhausted, and the children are suffering. And it is absolutely devastating ... our children are very much affected. We\'ve never seen numbers like this before,\" she said. , , A surge in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, fueled by the rapid spread of the Delta coronavirus variant, is happening in the US as millions of children are returning to schools. It is reigniting conversations on measures to lower transmission so students can safely be in the classroom. , But officials on the state and local levels have not streamlined their back-to-school mask wearing strategy, prompting local districts to create their own rules., In Texas, the Houston Independent School District\'s superintendent said he would move to mandate masks upon students\' return on August 23, despite GOP Gov. Greg Abbott\'s executive order prohibiting school districts and other local officials from requiring mask wearing., \"We have not seen kids pile into pediatric ICUs across the South like we\'re seeing right now,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN on Friday. , And as Covid-19 cases climb in Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order last week, telling the state\'s health and education departments to create rules preventing local school mask mandates. Two different lawsuits have since been filed against DeSantis over the executive order., On Friday, Florida\'s Orange County Public Schools said it would require students to wear masks -- except pupils whose parents opt them out with a signed note. Employees, visitors, volunteers and parents also will be required to wear masks, the district said., Hillsborough County Public Schools will \"require face coverings\" for the start of the school year but parents will be able to opt their children out of the requirement, according to a Saturday statement from Superintendent Addison Davis., \"While the outcome may be the same whether we make face coverings optional or required with an opt-out, we believe this decision continues to illustrate that Hillsborough County Public Schools takes public safety seriously,\" Davis said., Masks are optional for employees, Davis said., Returning to schools safely is possible if mitigation efforts, including wearing masks, are implemented, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, who heads the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. , \"The places where you see kids in the hospital, the places where you see footage of kids in the hospital, are all places that are not taking mitigation strategies to keep our children safe,\" Walensky said Friday. , The CDC recommends that everyone -- students, teachers, staff and visitors -- wear masks in schools., And while the CDC says 50% of the total population is fully vaccinated, children under 12 are still not cleared to be inoculated. , , US averages 100,000+ daily cases for first time since February, With the highly contagious Delta variant having increased its grip in the US, the daily coronavirus case rate is at its highest level in months., The US averaged more than 107,140 new daily cases over a week as of Friday -- the first time that average was higher than 100,000 since February, according to Johns Hopkins University data., The figure has generally risen since the country hit a 2021 low average of 11,299 daily on June 22, according to Johns Hopkins. , Hospitalizations and deaths have been rising, too., More than 63,250 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals on Friday -- a number that has generally risen since a 2021 low of 16,152 on June 29, according to the Department of Health and Human Services., About 497 Covid-19 deaths per day have been in the US in the past week -- well below the country\'s pandemic peak of more than 3,400 daily in mid-January, but still a 40% increase over the average a week ago, according to Johns Hopkins., , Boosters for people with a weaker immune system could be on the horizon , People with compromised immune systems could soon hear about a plan to give them a booster shot., A decision from the US Food and Drug Administration could come before early September, a Biden administration official told CNN. , The Washington Post reported Friday that in the next week or two, FDA officials are expected to review data on additional vaccine doses for immunocompromised people from the CDC. If the data checks out, the FDA will amend the emergency use authorizations of at least two Covid-19 vaccines to allow the additional doses, The New York Times reported. , The move could affect millions of people who may not have had an adequate response to the vaccine., That includes people taking drugs that suppress immune systems; some organ transplant patients; and those with certain medical conditions. Research published in JAMA Network Open estimates that 6 million people in the US are taking immunosuppressants that could interfere with the vaccine -- a number the researchers say is likely an underestimate., , Hospitals are strained amid Delta surge , As cases rise, hospitals and staff are facing dire situations., In Louisiana, more than 2,300 people were in hospitals with Covid-19 on Friday -- the highest number since the US Department of Health of Human Services began collecting the data in July 2020. , \"And I can tell you the indications are, we will go up by more than 100 more for tomorrow\'s report,\" Gov. John Bel Edwards said Friday. , More than more than 6,000 children have tested positive over the last week, Edwards said., \"So in light of that, and the CDC recommendations, the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the information that we\'ve received here from the Office of Public Health and leading Louisiana pediatricians, and quite frankly, as a parent myself, I have to ask -- why wouldn\'t we send our kids to school with a mask on?\" Edwards said., Edwards earlier this week issued an order generally requiring everyone 5 and older in Louisiana -- both vaccinated and unvaccinated -- to wear masks indoors, including in schools but excepting private residences., Edwards said he has hope, because 300% more people are receiving their first shot in the last month., And in Tennessee, Republican Gov.

That makes Alabama -- with 34.8% of its residents fully vaccinated -- the only state in the US to have fully vaccinated less than 35% of its residents. , The seven-day average of doses administered each day is now 706,323 doses, per the CDC data, and an average of 449,000 people are initiating vaccination each day., More hospitalizations and deaths expected , The US now is averaging more than 100,000 new Covid-19 cases every day -- the highest in almost six months, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. , Because it can take days or weeks for some Covid-19 cases to lead to hospitalization or death, doctors are bracing for an ugly repeat of scenes from 2020. , \"It\'s bad. For me, this is a deja vu of what we had last year,\" Varon said. , \"And the worst part about this is this was foreseeable. And this was preventable. So not only are (we) exhausted, we\'re annoyed. And we\'re annoyed because people are not doing the right thing.\" , The vast majority of those getting hospitalized with or dying from Covid-19 are not fully vaccinated, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the CDC, said last week. , And Americans who have already had Covid-19 shouldn\'t assume they don\'t need a shot., For adults previously infected with Covid-19, vaccines give better protection against reinfection than natural immunity on its own, according to a CDC study published Friday. , The study suggests people who got Covid-19 in 2020 and didn\'t get vaccinated were more than twice as likely to be reinfected in May or June 2021, compared with people who also had Covid-19 but were later fully vaccinated., \"If you have had Covid-19 before, please still get vaccinated,\" Walensky said Friday. , There is no minimum time to wait between recovering from Covid-19 and getting vaccinated, the CDC said. , \"Getting the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others around you,\" Walensky said, \"especially as the more contagious Delta variant spreads around the country.\", , Children\'s hospitals are getting overwhelmed, Almost half the country is not fully vaccinated, including children under 12 who are not yet eligible but are still vulnerable to Covid-19., Scientists say the Delta variant is as contagious as chicken pox, with each infected person potentially infecting eight or nine other people. , Delta may also cause more severe disease than other strains of coronavirus, according to studies cited in an internal CDC presentation. , Now some hospitals are seeing younger Covid-19 patients than before., \"Something very scary now is happening in the Southern United States.

As of late July, more than 99.99% of fully vaccinated Americans have not had a Covid-19 infection leading to hospitalization, according to CDC data., The tiny fraction of breakthrough infections that do lead to hospitalization can include those who are immunocompromised or elderly. , Those two groups may be among the first to get an additional dose of vaccine, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. , Because the Covid-19 vaccines require an immune response to work, those who are immunocompromised or taking immune-suppressing drugs might not get adequate protection with a vaccine. , \"We will almost certainly be boosting those people before we boost the general population that\'s been vaccinated,\" Fauci said Sunday. \"And we should be doing that reasonably soon, I believe.\", He said the next group that may need boosters sooner than the general population are those over age 60. Fauci said the CDC is studying different age groups to see how long vaccines may stay effective. , \"As soon as they see that that level of durability of protection goes down, then you\'ll see the recommendation to vaccinate those individuals,\" he said. , Long-haul Covid victim: \'I didn\'t think I fit the profile\', Quentin Bowen said he had scheduled an appointment to get vaccinated but had to cancel because of work. , The 41-year-old farmer from Nebraska said he assumed delaying his vaccination wasn\'t a big deal., \"I didn\'t think I fit the profile of who Covid (could) attack,\" Bowen said Saturday. \"I was healthy.

Florida on Friday reported 134,506 new Covid-19 cases over the last week, more than any other 7-day period during the pandemic., Roughly 58.4% of the US population has received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, according to CDC data. About 50% of the population is fully vaccinated. , Full vaccination is necessary for optimal protection against Covid-19 -- especially the highly contagious Delta variant, which accounted for an estimated 93.4% of all cases in the US in the two weeks ending July 31. , Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, echoed Walensky\'s take on how vaccination lowers the intensity of Covid-19 symptoms when breakthrough cases happen. , \"This is largely a problem when it comes to severe disease, the disease that requires hospitalization, it\'s among the unvaccinated. It really is pretty unusual to have a vaccinated person be hospitalized. Most of those people tend to be older and very, very frail. They never were able to respond to the vaccine, and we have the occasional immunocompromised person whose immune system also couldn\'t respond optimally to the vaccine,\" Schaffner told CNN on Thursday. , \"So the unvaccinated continue to be the big highway of transmission. The vaccinated, they\'re little side streets. Let\'s not get preoccupied with that. We need to get more people vaccinated.\", The good news is that vaccinations have picked up recently. , An average of 694,138 doses have been administered each day over the past seven days, up from a spring/summer low average of 506,770 daily reached on July 11, according to CDC data published Friday., And an average of 465,039 people initiated vaccination each day over the past seven days, the highest average daily pace in nearly seven weeks, since June 19, per the CDC. This is also an 11% increase over last week\'s pace -- about 47,000 additional doses each day. , If more people do get their shots, case surges can be controlled in a matter of weeks, Walensky said Thursday. , \"However, our models show that if we don\'t (vaccinate people), we could be up to several hundred thousand cases a day, similar to our surge in early January,\" she said. , , , Back-to-school season is looking grim amid Delta surge , But even as vaccinations rise, some children who have gone back to school have tested positive for Covid-19.  , Georgia\'s largest school district, Gwinnett County Public Schools, confirmed 253 cases on Friday, three days into the new school year. However, a spokesperson said many of the cases \"are from communal spread,\" because the people reporting cases \"haven\'t been in our buildings yet to have contracted\" the virus. , , \"Now that we\'re back in school, we know we\'re going to get cases,\" said Bernard Watson, director of community and media relations for the school system., Arizona\'s second-largest school district is dealing with 103 active cases of the virus, according to the district\'s online Covid-19 dashboard. Since the school year began on July 21 in Chandler Unified School District, there has been a total of more than 140 cases. , \"We will continue to monitor confirmed cases and make adjustments to our mitigation plan as necessary,\" Chandler Unified School District spokesperson Terry Locke told CNN Thursday., Only students who exhibit symptoms are required to quarantine in Chandler, and it is optional for all students with known exposure to Covid-19, regardless of their vaccination status. , Meanwhile, Indianapolis Public Schools officials on Tuesday notified the parents of 61 fourth-grade students that their child must \"quarantine for 14 days after coming in close contact with a school staff member who tested positive for Covid-19,\" district spokesperson Alpha Garrett said in a statement. , The students will continue learning remotely during their quarantine, Garrett added, and said the district requires students to wear masks regardless of vaccination status. , Masking students in schools is exactly what Walensky is urging districts to do as children under 12 years old remain ineligible for a vaccine. , , Speaking Friday at a town hall event in Boston, the CDC director said schools and summer camps where Covid-19 has spread are the ones that haven\'t followed mitigation measures like mask-wearing. , \"We follow every jurisdiction, and we look for outbreaks that are happening in camps and schools,\" Walensky said. \"The places that are having a problem, the places that are having disease that is transmitted in the schools, are the places that are not taking prevention strategies. ... , \"If you\'re masked and you\'re doing all of the prevention mitigation strategies, it won\'t be transmitted in the school. It will be contained,\" Walensky said., Some jurisdictions have mandated masks in schools, including New Jersey. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the mandate for the 2021-2022 school year on Friday, citing the spread of the Delta variant and the fact that many children are too young to be eligible for vaccination., The University of Virginia also updated its Covid-19 policy Friday to include a temporary mask mandate for students, faculty, staff and visitors. The university\'s policy statement says officials will monitor case counts and hospitalizations over the next few weeks \"with a goal of modifying or lifting this masking policy for fully vaccinated people by September 6th.\", Vaccination more than halves chance of Covid-19 reinfection, study suggests, For adults previously infected with Covid-19, vaccines do a better job at protecting them from reinfection than natural immunity on its own, a new study shows., The study, published Friday by the CDC, suggests that people who got Covid-19 in 2020 and didn\'t get a Covid-19 vaccine were more than twice as likely to be reinfected in May or June 2021, compared with people who also had Covid-19 but were later fully vaccinated., \"If you have had Covid-19 before, please still get vaccinated,\" Walensky said  Friday. \"Getting the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others around you, especially as the more contagious Delta variant spreads around the country.\", The CDC has long recommended that people who have been previously infected also get vaccinated. The agency noted that reinfection risk \"is low in the months after initial infection but may increase with time due to waning immunity.\" There is no minimum time to wait between recovering from Covid-19 and getting vaccinated., Scientists are still unraveling how long and how robust natural immunity to Covid-19 is, the authors noted. A number of earlier studies have shown evidence of lasting immunity in some people with previous Covid-19 -- but scientific consensus has maintained that vaccines do an even better job., With the Delta variant driving a surge in cases, the study also noted that \"the emergence of new variants might affect the duration of infection-acquired immunity, and laboratory studies have shown that\" those antibodies from natural infection might be weaker against certain variants of concern. , Meanwhile, studies of vaccinated people have continued to show high levels of protection, particularly when it comes to severe outcomes including hospitalization and death., The new study of hundreds of people in Kentucky did not assess severity of reinfections, and it noted that vaccinated people may be less likely to get tested, thus potentially skewing the numbers.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/06/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html',1,334),(245,'What experts are learning about Lambda, a coronavirus \'variant of interest\'','As the coronavirus pandemic continues, infections caused by the Lambda variant have been emerging in the United States, including in Texas, where Genomic sequencing has identified 1,060 cases of Covid-19 caused by the Lambda variant in the United States so far, according to the independent data-sharing initiative GISAID. While that number is a far cry from the surge in cases caused by the Delta variant -- representing about 83% of new cases in the US -- infectious disease experts have said that Lambda is a variant they are watching closely., The Lambda variant was first identified in Peru in December. The World Health Organization designates Delta as a \"variant of concern.\" Lambda is designated a degree lower as a \"variant of interest.\", \"I think any time a variant is identified and demonstrates the capacity to rapidly spread in a population, you have to be concerned,\" Dr. Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine and director of the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, told CNN on Friday., \"There are variants arising every day -- if a variant can be defined as new mutations,\" he said. \"The question is, do those mutations give the virus some sort of advantage, which of course is to human disadvantage? The answer in Lambda is yes.\", What is known about Lambda, There is a lot left to learn about Lambda., The variant is not nearly as worrisome as the Delta variant in the US, which has been driving a rise in cases nationwide, but early studies suggest that it has mutations that make it more transmissible than the original strain of the coronavirus., \"Lambda has mutations that are concerning but this variant remains quite rare in the US despite being around for several months,\" Dr. Preeti Malani, chief health officer in the division of infectious diseases at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, wrote in an email on Friday., \"It\'s difficult to know for certain how transmissible Lambda is and how well vaccines work. So far, it seems that Lambda is more transmissible than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus,\" which is similar to Delta and other variants, wrote Malani, an expert with the Infectious Diseases Society of America. SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19., \"Thankfully studies suggest that the currently available vaccines remain protective. We have learned during the pandemic that things can change quickly, so controlling spread of COVID-19 in general will help manage Lambda,\" Malani wrote. \"As long as there is uncontrolled spread of SARS-CoV-2, we will see more variants in the future. The only way out is widespread vaccination to control spread and prevent further mutation of SARS-CoV-2. It\'s a race between getting enough of the world vaccinated and the development of new variants that are less responsive to counter measures.\", So far, data remain split on how well vaccines protect against the Lambda variant, and scientists say they need to study this more., In July, researchers wrote in a lab study that they found some evidence that people who got the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine might benefit from a booster dose to better protect them from new variants of the coronavirus, including the Lambda variant. The study was done in the lab and does not reflect real-world effects of the vaccine -- and it\'s published online as a preprint to the server biorxiv.org, meaning it was not subject to careful peer review., Nathaniel Landau of the New York University Grossman School of Medicine and colleagues said their tests of blood taken from vaccinated volunteers shows that at least some of the newly emerging variants may evade the protection offered by a single dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s Janssen vaccine. A boost of a second dose of J&amp;J vaccine, or even with Moderna\'s or Pfizer\'s, might help, the researchers reported., In the study, the variants Beta, Delta, Delta plus and Lambda showed only \"modest\" resistance against antibodies elicited by the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus vaccines, suggesting the vaccines still work., A separate pre-print paper, posted last week to the online server biorxiv.org, found in lab experiments that three mutations -- called the RSYLTPGD246-253N, 260 L452Q and F490S -- found in the spike protein of the Lambda variant may confer resistance to immunity induced by vaccines, but more research is needed. The paper, authored by scientists in Japan, has not been published yet in a peer-reviewed journal., \"Two additional mutations, T76I and L452Q, help make Lambda highly infectious. Currently, the Lambda variant has been flagged as a \'Variant of Interest\' by the WHO. We do not know yet whether this variant is more concerning than the Delta variant,\" pharmacist and epidemiologists Dr. Ravina Kullar, who is an expert with the Infectious Diseases Society of America, wrote in an email on Friday., \"There needs to be extensive genomic surveillance studies that are done to assess how the vaccines\' efficacy is affected by the Lambda variant,\" Kullar wrote. Until Covid-19 cases overall decrease, \"the best way to prevent the emergence of more variants is getting fully vaccinated, not traveling internationally, and following strict infection prevention measures including wearing a face mask, physically distancing from others, and not attending large social gatherings.\", A game of \'Russian roulette\', Vaccines are vital to counter new coronavirus variants, such as Lambda, which might remain rare in the US but is associated with \"substantive rates of community transmission in multiple\" countries in the region, according to the WHO., Overall, Poland, the Mayo Clinic professor, warned that the more people don\'t wear masks and remain unvaccinated, the more likely additional variants will emerge in the future -- including one that might evade vaccines completely. Because as the coronavirus continues to jump from person to person, with each new infection, it changes a little bit -- just like any virus does -- and those changes or mutations could either be benign, or make it more easily transmissible and dangerous., Poland called it playing \"Russian roulette\" to allow a virus to spread freely with no mitigations, such as wearing masks or getting vaccinated., \"We will continue to develop more and more variants, and eventually, one or more of these variants will learn how to evade vaccine-induced immunity,\" Poland said. \"And if that\'s true, we will start all over again.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/07/health/lambda-coronavirus-variant-wellness-explainer/index.html',1,335),(246,'What you should know about the most underrated form of exercise ','For many of us, walking doesn\'t seem like anything special. It\'s just something we do every day. But walking is actually one of the best forms of exercise out there.Subscribe to CNN\'s Fitness, But Better newsletter: Get back in the groove. Sign up for our newsletter series to ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts, Scores of studies show that this simple form of movement has a wealth of wide-ranging benefits, including better physical and mental health, increased mindfulness and enhanced communication skills. , \"Walking is the most underrated, corrective, mind-body, fat-burning exercise available to humans,\" said Dana Santas, a CNN fitness contributor, certified strength and conditioning specialist, and mind-body coach in professional sports. \"I walk every single day.\" , Here are several things everyone should know about this simple, yet beneficial, form of exercise. (Important note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you feel pain.), Walking improves your health, A walking regimen can help you lose weight; lower your blood pressure and cholesterol; and reduce your risk for heart disease, diabetes and cancer; among other benefits. , \"Walking for Health,\" a special report issued by Harvard Medical School, says that walking can do more to combat disease and other health conditions than pretty much anything else. One example: Walking just two-and-a-half hours a week, or just under 22 minutes a day, might reduce your risk of heart disease by an impressive 30%. , It improves memory and cognitive capability, Numerous studies show that walking is a brain booster. , A study published in a 2010 issue of the journal Neurology found a link between walking and a greater amount of gray matter in the brain. For example, research from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville indicated walking lessened the risk for dementia and Alzheimer\'s disease in elderly men., It boosts your mood and lowers stress, , , Walking even a few minutes a day calms anxiety and enhances your mood. This is especially true if you\'re walking outside in nature, a setting that numerous studies show is beneficial in myriad ways., You can strengthen your muscles, bones and joints. Your leg and abdominal muscles get a workout when you walk, as do your arms if you\'re pumping them or using trekking poles. , Your bones benefit, too, as walking is a weight-bearing exercise, which is great for building bone strength. And as you walk, your motion helps bring oxygen and nutrients into your joint cartilage, which has no direct blood supply.  , Walking is energizing, yet also helps you sleep, A walking regimen helps boost your energy levels, but don\'t worry if you suffer from insomnia. Women ages 50 to 75 who walked for an hour every morning were less likely to have insomnia than those who did not, according to the Arthritis Foundation., It\'s a safe, easy exercise for newbies, Some 17% to 50% of Americans are inactive, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with percentages varying by state and territory. For these people, walking is arguably the cardiorespiratory exercise best suited to them, said Evan Matthews, associate professor of exercise science and physical education at New Jersey\'s Montclair State University. , \"This is because it is likely a familiar movement, removing the learning curve that occurs with a new form of physical activity and the intimidation factor many feel when starting out,\" he said. Walking is also safe with one of the lowest exercise injury rates, according to a report by the US Department of Health and Human Services. , Matthews noted those without the stamina to finish a 30-minute walk can break it up into small chunks, something not easily doable if you need to exercise at a gym. \"This could be a 10-minute walk to work, a 10-minute walk on your lunch break and a 10-minute walk home from work.\", Walking can be a vigorous workout, , If you want to ramp up the intensity, try intervals, where you alternate a few minutes of easy strolling with intense bursts. You can also walk with hand or ankle weights, assuming they are not so heavy that they throw off your form, Santas said. Or strap on a loaded backpack. Another option: hill repeats, where you walk briskly up a hill, then easily back down, several times in a row., You don\'t need to take 10,000 steps a day, While many groups tout walking 10,000 steps a day, research supported by the National Institutes of Health and published in 2019 found that while older women who took 4,400 steps a day had a lower death rate than those taking just 2,700, the benefit of more daily steps leveling off around 7,500. , Build family bonds, , , Heading out for a stroll with your children could enhance your communication, reduce behavioral issues and even boost academic success. And don\'t forget your spouse. , \"One man told me walking saved his marriage,\" Santas said. , The couple was on the brink of divorce when his wife began accompanying him on his daily walks. , \"They started communicating in ways they hadn\'t before, and it brought them back together.\", Develop community bonds, Studies show that when people frequently walk around their neighborhood, crime drops. Regular walks are also a great way to get to know your neighbors, and social bonds are important at any age., Walking is free and can be done anywhere, There\'s no need for a pricey gym membership. Just put on your shoes and head out the door. If the weather\'s bad, look for a place such as a mall or school that offers community walking time. You can even walk around your house., One final thought: While walking is a great form of exercise, new research shows we should move regularly throughout the day for optimal health. \"Walking for five minutes every hour goes a long way,\" Matthews said. \"It doesn\'t need to even be moderate intensity. Just move.\", , ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/06/health/walking-benefits-exercise-wellness/index.html',1,336),(247,'Fully vaccinated people who get a Covid-19 breakthrough infection can transmit the virus, CDC chief says','Fully vaccinated people who get a Covid-19 breakthrough infection can transmit the virus, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Thursday. \"Our vaccines are working exceptionally well,\" Walensky told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer. \"They continue to work well for Delta, with regard to severe illness and death -- they prevent it. But what they can\'t do anymore is prevent transmission.\", That\'s why the CDC changed its guidance last week and is now recommending even vaccinated people wear masks indoors again, Walensky said., Last week, the agency released a study that showed the Delta variant produced similar amounts of virus in vaccinated and unvaccinated people if they got infected -- data that suggests vaccinated people who get a breakthrough infection could have a similar tendency to spread the virus as the unvaccinated. , \"If you\'re going home to somebody who has not been vaccinated, to somebody who can\'t get vaccinated, somebody who might be immunosuppressed or a little bit frail, somebody who has comorbidities that put them at high risk, I would suggest you wear a mask in public indoor settings,\" Walensky said., The dangerous Delta variant has fueled the country\'s latest surge of Covid-19 cases and if more Americans don\'t get vaccinated and mask up, the country could soon be seeing \"several hundred thousand cases a day,\" similar to the winter surge, Walensky said. , And while states across the South -- including Florida and Louisiana -- have seen exponential rises in cases, Walensky said, they have not reached their peak just yet., \'Next variant is just around the corner\', Getting more people vaccinated won\'t just help crush this surge, experts say. It will help prevent other -- potentially even more aggressive  -- variants from arising in the future. , \"The next variant is just around the corner, if we do not all get vaccinated,\" Adm. Brett Giroir, the former coronavirus testing czar under President Donald Trump, told CNN\'s Chris Cuomo. , \"I just beg the American people to understand that to defeat this virus, we have to get everybody\'s level of immunity up, and that\'s just the way it is,\" he added., Roughly 58.2% of the US population has received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, CDC data shows, and about 49.9% is fully vaccinated. , There was some encouraging news Thursday, as White House data director Dr. Cyrus Shahpar tweeted there was the most number of doses reported administered in a single day in more than a month. He said that more than 864,000 doses had been reported administered over the previous day\'s total, including about 585,000 people who got their first shot., In the coming weeks, surges will likely reach all across the US, not just areas with low vaccination rates, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said Wednesday. The outbreaks, however, will not be as explosive in areas with higher vaccination coverage, Frieden added., As cases increase, hospitalizations and deaths will likely rise as well, according to ensemble forecasts published Wednesday by the CDC. The forecast predicts a total of 624,000 to 642,000 deaths will be reported by August 28. As of Wednesday, there have been 614,342 Covid-19 deaths in the US, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University., If you\'re not protected against Covid-19, the virus will likely infect you, Michael Osterholm, director for the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told CNN\'s Pamela Brown on Wednesday., \"This virus is highly infectious. If you decide to try to run the game clock out, don\'t try to do it. This virus will find you, it will infect you eventually,\" Osterholm, said, Fortunately, the available vaccines appear to offer a strong defense against the Delta variant, especially when it comes to severe illness and deaths, Frieden said. , \"We are at war with this virus that has already killed more than 610,000 Americans. We now have the tools with vaccines and masks to stop further death and suffering and destruction,\" CNN medical analyst Leana Wen said Wednesday. , FDA could lay out vaccine booster strategy next month, Meanwhile, as more questions arise over whether fully vaccinated Americans will need booster shots, a Biden administration official told CNN that internal discussions at the US Food and Drug Administration have centered around an early September timeline for laying out a strategy., That strategy would apply for all vaccinated people. A decision for those who are immunocompromised and face greater risk from Covid-19 is expected sooner, the official said., Earlier this week, Dr. Anthony Fauci said that people with compromised immune systems may need additional protection after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine -- and there is an effort to make vaccine booster shots available to those people \"very soon.\", \"There are those individuals who are immune compromised -- transplant patients, patients on cancer chemotherapy, patients on immunosuppressive regimen, for example, for autoimmune diseases,\" Fauci said during a virtual event hosted by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday. \"Those individuals we know almost invariably do not have an adequate response, so the need to give them an additional boost is much more emergent than the general population.\", Vaccine advisers to the CDC have met to discuss whether immunocompromised people may need additional protection from a vaccine booster but have not presented a recommendation or voted on guidance., On Wednesday, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said a recommendation from the federal government on vaccine boosters will come \"if and when\" there is evidence that rising infections are due to decreasing vaccine immunity., \"I recognize that individual doctors and their patients may make a decision ... around ... getting an extra dose and that may be as it is but formally, we cannot make that recommendation yet until we feel that the data is clear and indicates boosters are required,\" Murthy said., \'We\'ve let our children down,\' FDA vaccine adviser says, Low Covid-19 vaccination rates in the US place children -- many of whom cannot get vaccinated -- at risk, Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine adviser to the US Food and Drug Administration, said Wednesday., \"I think we\'ve let our children down,\" Offit told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer., There is not currently a vaccine authorized for children under the age of 12 in the US, so young children rely on the vaccination of those around them to protect them, Offit explained. And many children who are 12 and older have not yet gotten the vaccine, he added., Offit noted that many children are about to go back to school, during a time of year when the virus is transmitted more easily and the Delta variant is circulating., \"We need to get vaccination rates up, so that these children can be protected,\" Offit said., Highlighting that point, the president of Our Lady of the Lake Children\'s Hospital in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told CNN his staff is seeing babies in the neonatal intensive care unit sick with Covid-19., Dr. Trey Dunbar told CNN children are being victimized by a pandemic that has a simple solution: adult vaccination., \"Covid is a preventable disease,\" he said. \"It\'s hard for us as pediatricians to see kids affected by a preventable disease. Children aren\'t like adults. They don\'t have the choice to get vaccinated., \"So, yes, it makes a big difference when adults make decisions for kids and adults make decisions that could maybe prevent diseases that we see in children,\" Dunbar said., Concerns over America\'s youngest come as schools across the country gear up for reopening -- and as district leaders try to navigate the safest way to return to class. Having children wear masks remains a point of contention in communities throughout the US -- with some states requiring masks in schools while others have prohibited mask mandates. , On Thursday, Metro Nashville Public Schools sent a letter to families saying students, staff and visitors will be required to wear masks in school buildings when the school year kicks off next week. Masks will also be required on school buses, but not outdoors, the district said, adding the rule will stay in place \"until further notice.\", Only six ICU beds available in one state, Even after the development and release of Covid-19 vaccines that so many health care professionals had hoped for, rising cases have led to overwhelmed hospitals. , Arkansas health officials reported a \"record low number of available ICU beds,\" Wednesday. According to Arkansas Department of Health public information officer Danyelle McNeill, the state had just 25 ICU beds available., According to Arkansas\' Covid-19 dashboard, there was a total of 1,232 Covid-19 positive admissions. The total number of Covid-19 positive admissions in the ICU is 466, and the total Covid-19 positive admissions on ventilators is 260., As of Wednesday morning, Mississippi had only six open ICU beds available in the entire state, Dr. Jonathan Wilson, chief administrative officer and Covid-19 incident manager, said during a Covid-19 briefing with University of Mississippi Medical Center leaders. , \"A very simple number, six. That\'s how many open ICU beds we had in the state of Mississippi, this morning. Six. So, the situation is getting dire, not just here at the Medical Center, here in Metro Jackson, but the entire state. Our neighboring states are having similar situations,\" Wilson said., \"We\'re doing the best we can, from a state standpoint, to try to distribute patients to ensure healthcare as we know it is delivered. But we aren\'t on the cusp of this, we know that we aren\'t at the crest of this wave and it\'s bad, but it\'s probably going to get a little worse,\" Wilson added., Clarification: This story has been updated to specify that Dr. Walensky was referencing fully vaccinated people who get a breakthrough infection when saying that vaccines no longer prevent transmission of Covid-19.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/05/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html',1,337),(248,'Sharp decline in ads for Covid-19 vaccines, as the number of \'persuadable\' Americans diminishes ','As the Delta variant quickly spreads, and the number of US Covid-19 cases heads in the wrong direction, it\'s now more urgent than ever for people to get the Covid-19 vaccine. However, television ads persuading people to get vaccinated have declined sharply, according to a new analysis of national advertising data.If you watch TV at all, you have certainly seen them. The ads have catchy tunes and reassuring themes, they offer free beer, or promise that \"everything is going to be alright\" and tug at your heartstrings showing joyful pre-pandemic crowds that presumably can get together again once everyone is vaccinated. Even the Republican Senate Minority leader Mitchell McConnell taped one., In January there were more than 512 million ad impressions for Covid-19 vaccine-related spots, according to the analysis performed for CNN by iSpot, a company that measures impressions and performance of all TV ads. The company tracks viewership on over 18 million smart TVs across the US, then factors in US Census data to get a national picture of who is seeing the ads., Except for March, the number of Covid-19 vaccine ads grew steadily to reach a peak of 3.5 billion ad impressions in May. Since then, the number has been declining as has, until recently, the number of people getting vaccinated. In July, there were only about 713 million ad impressions for Covid-19 vaccine-related spots., Ad impressions drop off naturally in the summer months when fewer people are watching TV, but that\'s not the only reason you are not seeing as many of them. They\'re tapering off because, the advertising experts say, they are no longer working to persuade the unvaccinated., \"I believe that people are now actually inoculated against the Covid message instead of the Covid virus,\" said Punam Keller, the senior associate dean of innovation and growth at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. , Ad impressions are just one metric. For the analysis, iSpot also recruits panels of at least 500 US consumers with quotas for different demographics. The respondents answer questions about how much they liked an ad, how much it made them feel, and how persuaded they were. Those answers are quantified into additional data., Earlier this year, Covid-19 vaccine ads were about raising awareness and giving people information about them, according to John Cassillo, an analyst with TV[R]EV who works with iSpot. The ads ran on tentpole TV events like the NFL playoffs that had large audiences. , FedEx\'s ad Moving Forward, where images of weddings and roller coasters move backwards, as a faithful FedEx delivery driver rushes to deliver the Covid-19 vaccine \"so life can move forward,\" performed well. It was considered the second most successful with Republican and Libertarian audiences, that generally expressed more cynicism than Democrats about Covid-19 ads. , Another ad that did well, even among Republicans and Liberatarians, was one from Walmart that let people know its pharmacy would be ready to administer the Covid-19 vaccines. , Google\'s ad that showed people type in search terms like \"social distancing,\" \"lockdown,\" and everyone\'s favorite \"sweatpants,\" performed well in March. , And perhaps not a big surprise, Budweiser\'s ad that promised free beer for a vaccination became popular, too. , But after a few months, most people knew about the vaccines, and the ads started to slack off., \"I think once you create awareness among the most willing population to get it, then you have to re-evaluate and try something different,\" Cassillo said. , The people who were enthusiastic got the vaccine. , Now, there are two broad groups of the unvaccinated left in the US, explained Leonard Berry a distinguished professor of marketing at Texas A&amp;M University and a senior fellow at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. One is the group that says they will never get vaccinated, many for political reasons., Those who can still be persuaded fit into a few broad categories. They are more often young people, people with lower incomes, members of different minority groups, and people who live in rural areas. , \"The persuadables are not against it for political reasons. It\'s mostly because it\'s inconvenient, or they think \'I\'m healthy, I don\'t need it, I\'m not going to get it.\' Or they just haven\'t paid much attention,\" Berry explains. \"Conventional advertising is not the most effective medium for reaching and persuading with either of these groups.\" , Trustworthiness and credibility are also a big concern, and there is what Keller calls \"Low source credibility\" for Covid messages right now., \"The message source\'s ability or motivation to provide accurate and truthful information is in doubt,\" Keller said. \"So, if people don\'t believe that the person providing the message has the ability or the motivation to give them what is accurate and truthful information you\'re going to doubt the message.\", There were a group of ads that Republicans and Libertarian audiences did not find persuasive at all, according to research from iSpot. They did not think highly of an Ad Council ad featuring US presidents, Republican and Democrats who encouraged people to get the vaccine. , And even when Pfizer tugged at heartstrings about the vaccinated\'s ability to finally hug someone they loved, or see the next grandkid, this audience was not moved and considered it among the least persuasive ads they had seen in the pandemic., Keller explains that at some point the Covid-19 ads stopped working as well due to what\'s known in the advertising business as \"seizing and freezing.\", \"Seizing and freezing occurs when someone just seizes on the idea that this is a Covid message, and they basically freeze all subsequent processing and don\'t pay any more attention or process the rest of the message,\" Keller explained. \"Essentially, they think, \'I have a strong belief about Covid. Yes, this is a Covid message, I\'m done.\'\", Research from iSpot showed that the ads were more persuasive and likeable with Democrats than they were with Republicans, Libertarians, and independents and non-voters. Republicans more often found the ads either \"dishonest or incredulous,\" according to Sammi Scharninghausen, a brand analyst with iSpot. , \"You know, like a little hard to believe, skeptical, with very little, kind of, inspiring or heartfelt reaction,\" Scharninghausen said. \"It kind of echoes what we see with the persuasion scores.\" , A Monday Monmouth University national poll showed 31% of Republicans saying they will likely never get the vaccine., What seems to be working better than broad TV advertising now is targeted messaging and hyper local efforts, according to Heidi Arthur, the chief campaign development officer with the Ad Council, the charitable arm of the advertising industry that brought the world Smokey the Bear and McGruff the Crime Dog. , The Ad Council has a long history encouraging good public health behavior. In the 1950\'s it used celebrities like Elvis Presley, Dick Van Dyke, and Ella Fitzgerald on ads that ran on the networks to promote the polio vaccine. But the world isn\'t divided into three networks anymore and a message needs to reach people on multiple platforms. Younger people are not really watching network TV anymore. , So, rather than a broad ad, the Ad Council is much more focused on what they call the \"ground game.\" Coalition building, targeting programs to particular audiences in communities that haven\'t been reached with messages from voices they trust., \"It\'s not just about the ads, they\'re critically important, but really carrying those same research-based messages through to events, to toolkits that can really be used by communities that need this message,\" Arthur said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/06/health/covid-19-ads-why-theyve-gone-away/index.html',1,338),(249,'Half of US population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, official says','Half of the US population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, White House Data Director Dr. Cyrus Shahpar said Friday.More than 821,000 doses had been reported administered over the previous day\'s total, including about 555,000 people who got their first shot, Shahpar said in a tweet., \"50% of Americans (all ages) are now fully vaccinated.

It took about four months -- until late March -- to fully vaccinate a quarter of the US population, and another four and a half months to reach half, according to the CDC., An average of 699,261 doses have been administered each day over the past seven days, and an average of 464,778 people initiated vaccination each day over the past seven days, according to the latest data available from the CDC., Covid-19 vaccinations in the US reached a record high in mid-April, with an average of more than 3 million shots administered each day and about 2 million people initiating vaccination each day.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/06/health/coronavirus-us-half-population-fully-vaccinated/index.html',1,339),(250,'Most seniors who died of Covid-19 lived outside nursing homes','As covid-19 resurges across the country, driven by the highly infectious delta variant, experts are extending our understanding of the pandemic\'s toll on older adults — the age group hit hardest by the pandemic.New research offers unexpected insights. Older adults living in their own homes and apartments had a significantly heightened risk of dying from covid last year — more than previously understood, it shows. Though deaths in nursing homes received enormous attention, far more older adults who perished from covid lived outside of institutions., , The research addresses essential questions: Which conditions appear to put seniors at the highest risk of dying from covid? How many seniors in the community and in long-term care institutions might have died without the pandemic? And how many \"excess deaths\" in the older population can be attributed to covid?, Of course, it\'s already known that older adults suffered disproportionately. As of Aug. 4, more than 480,000 people age 65 and older perished from Covid-19 — 79% of more than 606,000 deaths in the U.S. overall, according to the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (This is likely an undercount because it relies on death certificate data that may not be up-to-date or accurately reflect the true toll of the virus.), , Still, new information about older adults\' vulnerabilities is useful as covid cases climb again and unvaccinated people remain at risk. Some key results from studies published over the past few months:, Death rates varied among groups of seniors. In a study published in Health Affairs in June, experts from the Department of Health and Human Services analyzed data for more than 28 million people with traditional Medicare coverage from February 2020 (the approximate start of the pandemic) to September 2020. (Excluded were about 24 million people in Medicare Advantage plans because data crucial to the study wasn\'t available.) The researchers compared data for this period with previous years, dating to 2015., The study examines deaths among individuals with covid and reaffirms headlines that have trumpeted the toll among older Americans. Medicare members diagnosed with covid had a death rate of 17.5% — more than six times the death rate of 2.9% for Medicare members who evaded the virus., A notable finding in the study: Medicare members with dementia were especially vulnerable. If diagnosed with covid, their death rate was 32%, compared with nearly 14% for those with dementia who weren\'t infected. Also at substantially increased risk of death from covid were older adults with serious and chronic kidney disease, immune deficiencies, severe neurological conditions and multiple medical conditions., Most of the seniors who died of covid lived outside of nursing homes. The HHS experts\' study reported 110,990 \"excess deaths\" due to covid during the eight-month period it examined — most likely an undercount because many older adults who died may not have been tested or treated for the virus. The term \"excess deaths\" refers to a death count higher than the number expected based on historical data. It is a core measure of the pandemic\'s impact., Of the excess deaths HHS experts documented, 40% occurred in nursing homes but a larger portion, nearly 60%, were seniors living in other settings., , Other studies suggest far more excess deaths. Estimates of excess deaths in the older population vary widely depending on the period studied, the data sources used and the type of analysis conducted. Another study, published in May in the BMJ (formerly known as the British Medical Journal), calculated 458,000 \"excess deaths\" in 2020 in the United States. About 72% were people 65 and older, according to the British and American authors., About two-thirds of these deaths can probably be attributed directly to covid, the authors noted. Others might be due to acute medical care that was delayed during the pandemic, poor management of chronic medical conditions, the effects of isolation and other factors., Assisted living residents were significantly affected. Data about the impact of the pandemic on assisted living residents has been scarce, in part because these facilities are regulated by states, not the federal government. A study out in June in JAMA Network Open found the death rate for assisted living residents in 2020 — as the pandemic unfolded — was 17% higher than in 2019. In the 10 states with the greatest community spread of covid, the death rate for assisted living residents rose by 24%., \"Efforts must be made to support assisted living communities as they work to address infection prevention and control to keep their residents safe,\" said Kali Thomas, a study co-author and associate professor of health services, policy and practice at Brown University.\", , Underlying medical conditions played a major role. A study by researchers from the Cleveland Clinic and the Health Data Analytics Institute in Dedham, Massachusetts, is one of the first to suggest how many older adults who caught covid would have died from underlying medical conditions even if the pandemic had not been underway. It, too, examined 28 million people with traditional Medicare coverage from the approximate start of the pandemic (the end of February) through November 2020. (Of 28 million people in the study, more than 2.4 % had a confirmed covid diagnosis and 10% had a \"probable covid\" diagnosis.), Other studies estimate excess deaths by looking at population-wide data. This study looked at individual data, using a highly complex methodology to calculate a preexisting risk of death for each person based on his or her age, sex, medical conditions and other demographic characteristics. Actual deaths in 2020 were then compared with expected deaths based on those preexisting risks. The report has been published as a preprint without peer review., About 4% of Medicare members with confirmed or probable covid who were living in the community, in their own homes and apartments, would have died anyway from underlying medical issues, the authors estimated. With covid, the actual death rate climbed to 7.5%., In nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, 20.3% of residents diagnosed with confirmed or probable covid would have died due to underlying medical issues; with covid, that rose to 24.6%, the authors calculated., , \"This is a more accurate picture of the true toll of covid,\" said Dr. Daniel Sessler, chair of the department of outcomes research at the Cleveland Clinic. \"As it turns out, the greatest increase in deaths [from the virus], in terms of both raw numbers and an increased risk of dying, was in the community, not in long-term care residents.\", The bottom line. About 80% of people 65 and older have been fully vaccinated, leaving millions of seniors still at risk of covid. Special attention should be paid to older adults with dementia and other serious neurological conditions, kidney disease and multiple medical conditions. Older adults, especially the eldest groups, who are frail and who live alone or with little support in areas where the virus is spreading rapidly also deserve special outreach and attention.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/05/health/seniors-covid-19-deaths-partner/index.html',1,341),(251,'CDC warns people to not eat raw cake batter after E. coli outbreak sickens 16','US health officials are warning people not to eat raw cake batter as they investigate The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that as of July 27, 16 people in 12 states have been reported to have been infected with the same strain of the E. coli bacteria., They range in age from 2 to 73-years-old and 75% of them are children under 18, the CDC said., Seven people had to be hospitalized, the CDC said, including one who developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure.

Like the Moderna data, the Pfizer follow-up data was collected prior to the Delta-related surge., Pfizer\'s pre-print paper showed its vaccine\'s efficacy -- in a trial involving 44,000 volunteers around the world -- peaked at more than 96% from a week to around two months after a second dose, and then appeared to gradually decline to 83.7% four to six months later, according to the paper, which had not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal., Moderna says boosters may be needed before winter, Moderna believes the Delta variant will lead to more breakthrough infections, and that boosters may be needed before winter, according to slides published ahead of the company\'s earnings call on Thursday., \"We believe that increased force of infection resulting from Delta, non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) fatigue, and seasonal effects (moving indoors) will lead to an increase of breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals,\" one of the slides says., Moderna also said that while it sees durable efficacy of the vaccine, it expects neutralizing titers will continue to wane and eventually impact the efficacy of the vaccine., \"Given this intersection, we believe dose 3 booster will likely be necessary prior to the winter season,\" a slide says., Moderna is waiting for dosage data before filing for an emergency use authorization (EUA) for a booster shot, Moderna president Dr. Stephen Hoge said in Thursday\'s investor call., Moderna\'s first two doses are 100 micrograms each.

It would give these supplemental doses to those who have consulted with their doctor beforehand. , Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA\'s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Tuesday the \"FDA does not recommend taking things into your own hands\" regarding Covid-19 vaccine booster shots., \"You can see all from looking at the news that there are people and the jurisdictions that are actually taking things into their own hands. ...

Fully vaccinated means that it has been two weeks since they completed a second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, the only vaccine authorized for those under 18. , So far, CNN has identified at least seven states -- Arkansas, Arizona, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah  -- that have prohibited mask mandates in schools at the state-level. Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Tuesday he regrets approving a statewide ban on face mask mandates earlier this year and has called the state legislature into a special session in an effort to amend the law., Most of these states have vaccinated a smaller share of adolescents than the national average, including Oklahoma, South Carolina and Arkansas, which have each vaccinated fewer than one-fifth of adolescents.   , Meanwhile, at least six states -- Connecticut, Hawaii, New Mexico, New York, Virginia and Washington -- require masks in schools, each of which has fully vaccinated a larger share of adolescents than the national average, including Connecticut, which is one of only three states to have vaccinated more than half of adolescents.  , Idaho was not included in CNN\'s analysis of CDC data, as data on adolescents by that state were not available. , As of Wednesday, the states that have vaccinated the most young people, according to the CDC\'s data, are:  , Vermont: 61% of adolescents fully vaccinated Massachusetts: 55% Connecticut: 51% Rhode Island: 49% Maryland: 49% , The states with the fewest adolescents fully vaccinated, according to the CDC\'s data, are: , Mississippi: 11% Alabama: 11% Louisiana: 13% Wyoming: 15% Tennessee: 17% , However, a recent rise in vaccinations across the United States might lead to a rise in the percentage of teens vaccinated in those states. , Across all ages, the pace of Covid-19 vaccinations in the United States has risen steadily over the past three weeks, particularly in several Southern states with poor vaccination rates and strong hesitancy against the shot, according to a separate CNN analysis of CDC data. , , Over the past two weeks, adolescents specifically have represented a larger share of new vaccinations than their share of the total population, CDC data shows. , As Covid-19 infections and hospitalizations nationwide have recently increased, largely attributed to the spread of the more dangerous Delta variant, so did the seven-day average of new vaccine doses administered -- up 26% from three weeks ago. Most people with severe cases of Covid-19 are unvaccinated. , The spike in vaccinations is most striking in several Southern states dealing with lagging vaccination rates. , Alabama\'s average, for instance, is more than double three weeks ago. The state has the country\'s lowest rate of its total population fully vaccinated, at 34%. Gov. Kay Ivey on July 23 called out \"the unvaccinated folks\" for the rise in Covid-19 cases there. , Arkansas, with just 36% of its population fully vaccinated, also has seen its average daily rate of doses administered double in the last three weeks. , Louisiana, which had by far the most new cases per capita last week and only 37% of its population fully vaccinated, saw daily vaccination rates rise 111% compared to three weeks ago. , McDonald\'s and iPads for vaccinated teens, Overall, Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, told CNN on Wednesday that she was not surprised by the range among states in the number how adolescents fully vaccinated  -- emphasizing that the states with fewer young people vaccinated also have had leadership that has not been supportive of certain Covid-19 mitigation measures, such as mask-wearing, and some political leaders have shared misinformation about Covid-19. , , \"When people hear that (misinformation) over and over again, it does impact our ability to get those vaccination rates up, not only for our kids, but in our communities. So, we\'re going to continue to work to combat that,\" Pringle said. , In December, the NEA published a position statement saying that vaccines are \"essential medical tools in preventing infectious diseases\" and that parents should follow vaccination guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC. , \"Our teachers have been working directly with parents in assuring them, for example, that the schools are safe and we\'re going to be doing the same thing with vaccinations,\" Pringle said. \"We\'re going to be arming our educators, all of them, with information so that they can provide that information directly to parents and try to get those vaccination rates up.\" , , More city and county health departments are partnering with K-12 public schools to host Covid-19 vaccination clinics or develop ways to incentivize vaccines for young people ages 12 to 17 -- working down to the wire, as many schools have already started classes. , \"There is a large national effort underway to promote school vaccine clinics being held or incorporated into back-to-school activities,\" Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN on Wednesday. , \"We\'re hearing from our health departments actively working with their school districts to support school vaccination efforts, including working with school nurses in the community to make sure they have needed resources and assistance to host a successful vaccine clinic -- and that is certainly happening universally across the country in different jurisdictions,\" she said. \"As we head into the start of classes this month, we\'re seeing more and more schools talking about incorporating vaccine clinics into their programs, where possible.\" , , Some schools and local health departments also are offering incentives for teens to get vaccinated, Freeman said. , \"We have started to see the active use of incentives, because the American Rescue Plan Act has freed up money to do that,\" she said. \"More things for kids and teens are being offered, like college scholarships, for example, or iPads, or computer equipment -- more student-oriented types of incentives.\" , In Washington, DC, for instance, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced last week that students who are eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine will also be eligible to win an iPad or a $25,000 college scholarship. \"Once student names are drawn, a District representative will reach out to the family to confirm the student\'s vaccination status. If the student is already vaccinated, they will be able to claim their prize,\" according to the announcement., Paterson Public Schools in New Jersey announced on Tuesday that the district will offer transportation to Covid-19 vaccination sites for eligible students and their families, and students who get vaccinated will be offered a $10 voucher to a nearby McDonald\'s. , The first day of classes is on September 8 for Paterson Public Schools -- five weeks from now.  , , For the students who might not be fully vaccinated by the first day of school, Shafer told CNN on Wednesday that as long as they start the process of getting vaccinated is what matters, especially with the more transmissible Delta variant circulating. , \"I don\'t think with this virus and variant that anything is too little, too late. This is about saving lives,\" Shafer said, adding that the school district has been encouraging vaccinations since the spring. , \"This right now for us is just a really big push, because we see things getting worse -- and I want to take all roadblocks away, whether it\'s transportation, or whether it\'s an incentive, whatever it is, I just want to make sure that we\'re addressing it to make it easier for parents to get their child vaccinated,\" Shafer said. \"I don\'t think with this anything is ever too little, too late.\" , Correction: A previous version of this article included Vermont among the states prohibiting mask mandates.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/05/health/covid-19-vaccinations-for-teens-state-rankings-analysis/index.html',1,346),(254,'If you\'re not protected against Covid-19, the virus \'will find you, it will infect you,\' expert says ','If you\'re not protected against Covid-19, the virus will likely infect you, one expert told CNN on Wednesday. \"This virus is highly infectious.

But it isn\'t. it\'s about everybody else, also,\" he said. , Roughly 58% of the US population has received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roughly 49.8% of the population is fully vaccinated, the data shows. , More than 90 million eligible people in the US are still unvaccinated. And though the seven-day average of people initiating vaccination each day is the highest it has been since July 4 at 446,300, many experts say the US is still not where it needs to be to get the pandemic -- and the rapidly spreading Delta variant -- under control. , On Tuesday, for the first time since February, more than 50,000 hospital beds across the country were occupied by Covid-19 patients, according to new data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. That number is more than triple what it was a month ago. , \"This surge that we\'re going through right now has every potential to be -- and already looks to be -- the worst surge we\'ve faced so far,\" former US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said during a live online interview with The Washington Post. ,  Delta variant now accounts for more than 93% of Covid-19 cases in the US, The Delta variant now accounts for an estimated 93.4% of coronavirus circulating in the US, according to figures published by the CDC., This includes several sub-lineages of Delta, all of which are classified as variants of concern. Together, they made up about 93.4% of cases during the last two weeks of July., This number is even higher in certain parts of the country, including the region that includes Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska, where Delta accounts for more than 98% of circulating virus., These figures have shown a rapid increase over the past two months. In the two weeks ending May 22, for example, Delta\'s prevalence was estimated around 3%., At that same time in May, another variant first identified in the UK -- Alpha, or B.1.1.7 -- was the dominant one in the US, causing 69% of cases. Now, CDC\'s most recent estimates put that variant at just under 3%., Experts considering boosters for immunocompromised people, Fauci says , Although experts have said data so far does not indicate a need for the general population to get vaccines boosters, Fauci said there is an effort underway to get them for immunocompromised people. , Some conditions -- including autoimmune diseases, transplants and cancer treated with chemotherapy -- compromise people\'s immune systems. , \"Those individuals we know almost invariably do not have an adequate response, so the need to give them an additional boost is much more emergent than the general population,\" Fauci said during a virtual event hosted by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday. , Vaccine advisers to the CDC have met to discuss whether immunocompromised people may need additional protection from a vaccine booster but have not yet presented a formal recommendation or voted on guidance. , \"We are trying very hard to get the regulatory mechanism in place very soon to get those individuals a boost that might bring up their immunity to the level where it should be, if possible,\" Fauci said., During a discussion hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Tuesday, Fauci said it\'s \"very likely\" Covid-19 variants evolved in the bodies of those who are immunosuppressed. , People with immune suppression may be unable to fight off Covid-19 infections for weeks or even months, meaning the virus has plenty of time to evolve and change., \"Variants, we all know, have emerged because of the pressure that the human immune system has put on the virus, very likely from people who are immunosuppressed ... and had virus in them for days and days and days before they cleared it and/or died, and then essentially led to the emergence of a variant,\" Fauci said., \'Substantial\' increase in cases among children and teens , With the new school year stirring concerns about protecting children from Covid-19, the American Academy of Pediatrics said Tuesday there\'s been a \"substantial\" increase in cases among children., Nearly 72,000 children and teens caught Covid-19 last week -- five times as many as at the end of June, the group said. , The definition of a child varies by state, but generally includes those up to age 17 or 18. , Covid-19 protocols vary across the country, but when children go back to school, districts will need to know how to respond to outbreaks quickly., Districts need to be prepared to enact contact tracing, testing, the quarantining of people who were exposed to the virus and the isolation of people with infections, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told CNN. , While most schools follow those steps to isolate cases, contact trace and test, response plans can vary state by state and school district by school district, Kim Anderson, executive director of the National Education Association, told CNN. , \"From what we understand, it does depend on what district you are in. The district should have very well thought-out outbreak plans that have included the voices of educators and parents and community members in the crafting of those plans, and they should have plans that follow the CDC recommendations,\" Anderson said., \"Our recommendation to all students and school districts is to follow the medical experts and follow the CDC,\" she said.

An expert weighs in','The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has changed its guidance to once again recommend that even vaccinated people start masking indoors in areas of the country withAt the same time, Disney, Netflix, Google, Walmart and the federal government announced plans to implement some type of vaccine requirement for employees returning to in-person work. , Is it safe for vaccinated people to return to work if vaccine mandates are in place? What if they are not -- is masking enough, and what if others around you are unvaccinated and not wearing masks? What about workers who have children too young to be vaccinated? , To help us navigate these uncertain times, we turned to CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She\'s also author of a new book, \"Lifelines: A Doctor\'s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.\", CNN: We know that breakthrough infections can happen. How does it help to have vaccine mandates at work if the vaccinated can also spread Covid-19?, Dr. Leana Wen: Vaccine requirements will help make workplaces much safer for everyone. Here\'s why. There is a lot of misunderstanding about what the CDC\'s new data is showing. The agency found that vaccinated people infected with Covid-19 may carry just as much virus as those who are unvaccinated and have Covid-19. , However, the chance of actually contracting Covid-19 is greatly reduced if you\'re vaccinated. According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, you have an estimated eight-fold reduction in risk of having coronavirus if you\'re vaccinated compared to if you\'re not -- and an estimated 25-fold reduction in risk of having severe enough disease to cause hospitalization and death, which is truly remarkable., , , Put a different way, if I have to spend time in an enclosed, indoor space with someone, the chance of that person having coronavirus and potentially being able to infect me is an estimated eight times less if they are vaccinated. That\'s why vaccine requirements at work make sense. It dramatically reduces the chance that your coworkers could be infected. And because you are vaccinated, too, your chance of getting Covid-19 from them is also reduced an estimated eight-fold from if you were not vaccinated. , Could it be possible that someone has coronavirus, and you still contract it from them? Yes. The higher the coronavirus transmission rate in your community, the more likely someone has Covid-19, even if they are vaccinated. However, it is much safer to share space with people when everyone is fully vaccinated. , , , , CNN: What if the workplace allows people to opt out of vaccination through testing?, Wen: It depends on how frequent the testing is. Testing is not a strategy that prevents someone from contracting Covid-19. However, if there is frequent testing, it could pick up on infections quickly and prevent that person from spreading it. I\'d feel more comfortable with twice-weekly testing than weekly testing. Either the antigen test or PCR test should be fine, as long as it\'s authorized by the FDA., Test less frequently and I think you get into a situation of false reassurance. Just because someone tested negative a week ago doesn\'t mean that they couldn\'t have contracted coronavirus in the meantime. And if they are unvaccinated, they have a higher chance of getting Covid-19 and therefore of passing it on to you., CNN: Should workplaces require both vaccinations and masking?, Wen: This is an interesting question, and one that the CDC has not really weighed in on. Right now, the CDC is saying that indoor masking should occur in areas of high or substantial Covid-19 transmission, and they are not saying that if everyone is vaccinated, masks are no longer needed., I think this is a mistake. The risk of vaccinated people transmitting to other vaccinated people is low. At some point, we have to accept that we\'re not going to get zero risk. Workplaces need to protect their employees, and a vaccine requirement is a very good level of protection. If a workplace truly has an enforced vaccine mandate with proof of vaccination, I think they could make masking optional instead of required., That said, some individuals may choose to be more careful at work. That\'s also completely understandable. I hope that workplaces allow accommodations to be made. For example, there may be some people who are immunocompromised. They may not want to sit in a crowded conference room with maskless -- but vaccinated -- peers, because even a small risk to them is too much. I hope employers will allow such employees to work from home, or to be in a separate physical space and to call in to virtual meetings. Of course, not all workplaces can reasonably make these accommodations, and this is once again why vaccine requirements are so important. They reduces risk substantially., CNN: What if a workplace doesn\'t require vaccines? Is masking enough? Or what about places that don\'t require either?, Wen: A workplace that doesn\'t require vaccines but continues to abide by strict masking and distancing, and has good ventilation, is also pretty safe. Adding testing on top of that will be a helpful additional layer of protection. The quality of the mask matters -- in these situations, people should at least wear a three-ply surgical mask. And it\'s important that everyone consistently wears their mask -- not dangling around the necks, but fully covering their nose and mouth. , If the workplace doesn\'t require vaccines or masks, and you know that you are surrounded by maskless people who are probably unvaccinated, that\'s a much riskier situation for you. Know that you are still well-protected from severe illness; but depending on the infection rate in the community around you, you could be at risk of a breakthrough infection. , Try to take steps to protect yourself. Wear an N95 or KN95 mask when in close proximity indoors with these maskless people of unknown vaccination status. Try to stay distanced from them, and if possible, ask for accommodations to sit in a separate space. Open the window and door to increase air flow. Stay out of crowded gathering areas like breakrooms and cafeterias. Know that risk is cumulative. The more people you are exposed to, the higher your risk., You could also see whether other employees feel as you do. More and more workplaces are implementing vaccine requirements -- or at least a testing requirement. It\'s possible at your workplace that those who want these mandates are in the majority. Your voices need to be heard, and they could make a difference., CNN: What\'s your advice for parents of young kids or people living at home with immunocompromised family members? Should they try to keep working from home?, Wen: This is really tough. Many people are in this situation where we may not be so concerned about a breakthrough infection to us, because chances are it will be mild, but we are very concerned about potentially being a carrier who could infect those we live with., Taking precautions at work is important. Vaccine requirements would make me feel much safer. I\'d be comfortable going to work, and not wearing a mask, if everyone around me is guaranteed to be fully vaccinated. I\'d probably still try to stay out of the highest risk settings, like cramped, poorly ventilated conference rooms where dozens are sitting shoulder-to-shoulder for hours at a time. , , , , If I\'m not certain that the others around me are vaccinated, I would make sure to wear a high-quality mask when around them indoors. Other people will be even more cautious. Someone who lives at home with an elderly parent on immunosuppressant medications may want to follow the CDC guidelines to the letter and wear a mask even if everyone around them is known to be vaccinated. Still others may choose to work at home if that\'s an option available to them. We all have different tolerance of risk, and I hope companies will try to make reasonable accommodations for people\'s living situations., This is a very confusing time for everyone. It feels like the US has taken a step backward in our fight against the pandemic, and we have. The Delta variant has changed things again. We need to keep being vigilant, reassess our own risk and our family\'s, and keep in mind that vaccination remains key to protecting ourselves and our loved ones.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/04/health/vaccinated-people-return-to-work-wen-wellness/index.html',1,351),(257,'FDA does not recommend \'taking things into your own hands\' regarding Covid-19 vaccine boosters, says top agency official ','Dr. Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration, said on Tuesday that the \"FDA does not recommend taking things into your own hands\" regarding Covid-19 vaccine booster shots.\"You can see all from looking at the news that there are people and the jurisdictions that are actually taking things into their own hands ...

As of Monday, 23 people were waiting for space to open up in the ICU, said Dr. Catherine O\'Neal, chief medical officer of Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge., \"You have people with chest pain sitting in an ER right now while their families sit in the waiting room. And they are wringing their hands. And they are calling everybody they know\" to get into an ICU, O\'Neal said., About two weeks ago, the hospital had 36 Covid-19 patients. As of Monday, it had 155. . , \"No one diagnosis should take up one quarter of your hospital,\" O\'Neal said. \"We no longer think we\'re giving adequate care to anybody because these are the darkest days of the pandemic.\" , O\'Neal stressed the need for more people to get vaccinated. And because the vaccines don\'t fully kick in until two weeks after the final dose, she said it\'s important to keep wearing masks. , New mask mandates and vaccine requirements, The Delta variant is several times more contagious than the original strain of novel coronavirus and appears to cause more severe disease, according to an internal presentation from the CDC., While fully vaccinated people are still less likely to get infected, the CDC updated its guidance last week, saying even vaccinated people in areas with substantial or high transmission should mask up when in indoor public places. , That guidance covers more than 90% of the US population -- about 300 million people, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data published Monday., Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards temporarily reinstated his state\'s mask mandate for all people ages 5 and older, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, in indoor public places. The mandate goes into effect Wednesday., Wearing masks is important to help keep \"our kids back in school and in-person and maintaining our growing economy by keeping businesses open,\" said Dr. Joseph Kanter, Louisiana\'s state health officer. , No one should mistake the current situation as \"just another surge,\" Edwards said., \"We\'ve already had three of these.

He later took to Twitter to clarify his comments, saying there\'s no need to mask at home, but \"parents who live in communities with high COVID transmission rates should mask when out in public indoor settings to minimize risks to their unvaccinated kids.\" , \"It\'s clear that this variant is capable of causing serious illness in children. You have heard those stories coming out of Louisiana pediatric ICU\'s where there are kids as young as a few months old who are sick from this,\" the director of the National Institutes of Health said., The CDC has a list of ways parents can help keep their children safe, including:, -- Get vaccinated yourself. Covid-19 vaccines reduce the risk of people getting and spreading Covid-19., -- If your child is 2 years or older, make sure your child wears a mask in public settings., -- If your child is younger than 2 years or cannot wear a mask, limit visits with people who are not vaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. And keep distance between your child and other people in public., Questions arise about booster shots, The San Francisco Department of Public Health said Tuesday it will allow people vaccinated with the one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine to receive a supplemental mRNA vaccine dose. Doses will be available at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital., Health department officials said they were making an \"accommodation\" for those who have consulted with a physician and said it was not a recommendation or policy change., This comes after Pfizer released data last week saying a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine can \"strongly\" boost protection against the Delta variant. The company plans to submit data on a third dose of its vaccine to the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Mikael Dolsten, who leads worldwide research, development and medical for Pfizer. , However, the decision on if and when booster shots will be necessary will be made by agencies like the FDA and CDC, according to US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy., \"This data from Pfizer, we\'ve been in talks with them about what they\'re seeing with regard to their studies related to boosters,\" Murthy said, when asked about Pfizer\'s new data. \"But at this point, I want to be very clear: People do not need to go out and get a booster shot.\", In San Francisco, though, officials said the health department\'s decision to allow a supplemental dose aligns with the CDC, which does not currently recommend a booster shot for anyone, including J&amp;J recipients. , \"We are not recommending. We are accommodating requests,\" Dr. Naveena Bobba, deputy director of health for the department, said during a media briefing. \"We have gotten a few requests based on patients talking to their physicians and that\'s why we are allowing for the accommodation.\", When asked whether anyone can walk in and receive a supplemental mRNA vaccine dose, Bobba said that each vaccine site in the city will choose how to proceed with the accommodation, but \"the expectation is that they have had a discussion with a health care provider when they come in.\", \'The vaccines are doing exactly what we\'re asking them to do\', Reports of infections among vaccinated people, known as breakthrough infections, have caused some concern among the public. But experts say they are not as alarming as they may seem. , \"The vaccines are doing exactly what we\'re asking them to do when it comes to keeping you out of the hospital, out of serious disease and certainly preventing your death,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases., Vaccines provide an eightfold reduction in people getting the disease and a 25-fold reduction in both Covid-19 related hospitalizations and deaths, Fauci said., \"An important point to bring up is that the greater percentage of people that are vaccinated, even with a high degree of protection, the absolute number of breakthrough infections might appear high,\" he said., \"You can expect breakthrough infections. Most of these infections are going to be asymptomatic or mild.\", \"The bottom line of what we are saying is ... Get vaccinated,\" Fauci said., Efforts are underway to expand Covid-19 testing, Fauci said Tuesday at a discussion hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Such testing is made more important by the impending flu season and the push for Covid-19 treatments, he said. , \"If you get into the flu season, where people present with very similar symptomatology, then you\'re going to want a test that will tell you immediately, is this flu? Is this SARS-CoV-2? Or is this something else, whatever that might be. RSV, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, whatever,\" Fauci said., But there\'s promising news in states hit hardest by this surge, White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients said., \"In the states with the highest case rates, daily vaccination rates have more than doubled,\" Zients said Monday., \"The eight states with the highest current case rates have seen an average increase of 171% in the number of people newly vaccinated, each day over the past three weeks,\" he said.,  \"Louisiana has seen a 302% increase in the average number of newly vaccinated per day, Mississippi 250%, Alabama 215%, and Arkansas 206%,\" Zients said., \"Americans are seeing the risk and impact of being unvaccinated and responding with action.

We\'re going to have to track it closely.\", Throughout the pandemic, public health officers have reported receiving death threats and harassment in response to their recommendations to wear masks and follow certain Covid-19 mitigation measures. For instance, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has spoken openly about receiving death threats., CNN previously reported that during a live public briefing on Facebook last year, \"someone very casually suggested\" Los Angeles County\'s public health director, Barbara Ferrer, should be shot. And in Washington state, Okanogan County community health director Lauri Jones installed a new security system and asked for police patrols around her home following repeated online threats., Such incidents are now occurring again, according to NACCHO, and the organization is tracking reports of threats, harassment and intimidation., \"Just last week, we started seeing extremist groups come out again in opposition to their public health officers\' orders in California,\" Freeman said. \"Another example, in North Carolina, involved school board meetings where parents were picketing that there was no way they were sending their kids to school in masks. Really, this is going on in different places across the country.\", Last week in Florida, about 20 anti-mask protesters gathered at the Broward County School Board headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Tuesday, forcing a postponement of a discussion on mask requirements for the upcoming school year, a school board member told CNN., \"Folks weren\'t wearing masks and refused to follow the rules -- rules that people have followed for the last year and a half,\" School Board Member Sarah Leonardi said of the protesters. \"It made it very difficult to hold our meeting behind closed doors.\", Leonardi said the group set masks on fire during their demonstration and called the protest \"very disturbing.\", Video of the protest from CNN affiliate WFOR showed a protester dousing a catering tray full of masks with lighter fluid before setting it on fire with a lighter., Such protests and reports of harassment are happening as the more dangerous and highly transmissible Delta coronavirus variant circulates nationwide, leading to a surge in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations., In response, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance on masks last week, recommending that everyone older than age 2 wear masks in schools, whether vaccinated or not., \"We\'re hearing a lot of challenges on the ground, especially in states choosing not to take up the mask mandates that were recommended last week and opting to instead push decisions on masking down locally,\" Freeman said., \"When the state doesn\'t want to take a hard line, it naturally falls to community-level decisions and so we\'re back to local health departments being front and center of controversy around the reintroduction of masks for vaccinated people,\" she said., These pressures of the pandemic seem to be taking a toll on the public health workforce., Freeman previously told CNN in May that NACCHO has tracked more than 250 public health officials leaving the field since the beginning of the pandemic., In Kansas alone at the time, more than 30 health officials left their posts since the beginning of the pandemic, a Kansas Department of Health and Environment spokeswoman told CNN in May.

But when they left, Camila, 13, had also gotten a shot: the first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech\'s Covid-19 vaccine. , \"I want to get our life back together,\" Camila, who will soon start eighth grade, told CNN. She wants to go out in public without a mask, she says. She wants to go on family vacations and wants to go to school safely in person, saying she has struggled with remote learning. \"And I also want to be safe.\", Camila was vaccinated at a site set up by Austin Public Health in Del Valle, Texas, on the edge of the capital city, in partnership with the nonprofit Emancipet, which offers routine health care for dogs. Officials were there looking for people like Camila, who are unvaccinated but willing to change that. , With the pace of inoculations slowing, Austin is scrambling to get more shots in arms, dedicating personnel at sites across the city -- vet clinics, churches, rec centers, construction sites, homeless shelters -- just to vaccinate 10, 15 or 20 people at a time. , Overall, Travis County, which includes Austin, is doing relatively well in terms of vaccinations. About 63.4% of the county\'s population over age 12 is fully vaccinated, according to data Monday from the Texas Department of State Health Services, compared with about 52.9% of the state\'s population over age 12., But it\'s not enough to stem the rising tide of infections and hospitalizations driven by the Delta variant, officials say., Austin Mayor Steve Adler told CNN the county and the city had done well, and he touted the high rate of vaccinations. \"Which just goes to show this Covid variant, Delta, is just that much more infectious and having that much greater impact,\" he said. , Early on, thousands of people a day were getting vaccinated in Austin, Dr. Desmar Walkes, Austin-Travis County health authority, told CNN.

She says she initially didn\'t want to get vaccinated. But she was the last member of her family to need it -- everyone else had been vaccinated. , So, she decided to listen to someone she trusts -- her mom, who told her the vaccine was the best path to a return to normalcy. , \"My mom was talking to me in the car, and she was like, \'You know, if you want the world to get better, we need to help,\'\" Camila said. \"Everyone needs to get vaccinated.\" , , \'An epidemic among the unvaccinated\', After weeks of progress, Covid-19 cases are rising rapidly in states across the country. In Texas, the seven-day moving average was 9,789 new daily cases on Monday, according to a CNN analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. That\'s way up from July 1, when the seven-day moving average of new daily cases was about 1,500., Austin is also feeling the surge. The city\'s Covid-19 dashboard showed a seven-day moving average of about 365 new daily cases on Monday, up from about 34 on July 1. Hospitalizations are also up, with a seven-day average of 346 patients reported over the prior week as of Monday, compared to 57 patients at the beginning of July., \"This Delta variant has really caused an alarming increase in the number of cases,\" Walkes told CNN. \"We\'ve gone from 30 cases a day to almost 400 cases a day in a matter of almost two-and-a-half, three weeks.\", \"That\'s because we have still a lot of people who are unvaccinated,\" she said. , Nearly everyone in the city\'s hospitals aren\'t vaccinated, Adler told CNN., \"Almost everyone in our ICUs are people who are not vaccinated. We have no one on ventilators in our city that are vaccinated,\" he said. \"This is an epidemic among the unvaccinated.\" , Last week, the city moved to Stage 4 out of 5 of its risk-based guidelines, recommending that partially or unvaccinated people avoid private gatherings, dining, travel and shopping unless it\'s absolutely essential. And everyone -- vaccinated or not -- is advised to wear a mask. , Meantime, Gov. Greg Abbott has said he will not impose a statewide mask mandate and has previously banned local government entities from requiring vaccines. , Texans know \"what the standards are, what practices they want to adopt to help protect themselves,\" he told CNN affiliate KPRC last week. \"This is time for individual responsibility.\" , But on the front lines, Adler said, that sort of messaging is \"making it harder for us to get the behaviors we want, when our governor is not ready to actually join in a way that sends an unambiguous message to the community about the need to get vaccinated and about the ability and importance for people to wear masks while infection levels are real high.\", , Targeting the \'movable middle\', Still, Austin officials and the governor agree that vaccines are effective against the virus., Health officials are focused now on what Walkes describes as the \"movable middle\" -- people who are looking for more information or need their concerns to be addressed on a one-on-one basis. , So-called strike teams are mobilizing in communities to find these individuals where they live, work and play, Walkes says. , But that means there\'s more manpower being spent to vaccinate fewer people. And officials also have to fight misinformation, convincing people the vaccines are safe and effective, she says. , \"Every person that we can vaccinate is another person that\'s not going to be sick,\" she said. \"The vaccines work to prevent severe illness, hospitalization and death.\" , The efforts Austin has made to increase vaccinations is a pattern playing out across the state. , The Texas Department of State Health Services will award $10 million to local organizations promoting vaccines, like educational agencies, faith-based organizations, community coalitions and nonprofits, it has announced., There has been some success in Austin, Walkes says, describing a \"slight uptick\" in people coming out to get vaccinated, especially when it comes to kids like Camila. , \"Particularly, we\'re seeing parents bringing kids out to get vaccinated,\" Walkes said, \"because we\'re weeks away from reopening school, and we want to do what we can to keep our kids safe.\", Correction: A previous version of this story used the incorrect spelling for the nonprofit Emancipet.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/03/health/austin-texas-vaccination-rate/index.html',1,355),(261,'San Francisco will let people who got the J&amp;J vaccine get a supplemental mRNA vaccine dose ','People vaccinated with the one-shot Johnson &amp; JohnsonSan Francisco Department of Public Health officials are making an \"accommodation\" for those who have consulted with a physician, they said Tuesday.

Some people are hoping to boost their immunity by supplementing their J&amp;J shot with an mRNA vaccine by Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna., Johnson &amp; Johnson said in early July that data shows its vaccine provides immunity that lasts at least eight months, and it appears to provide adequate protection against the worrying Delta variant. , A test-tube study later that month, which has not been peer reviewed, suggested that people who got the single-dose vaccine might benefit from a booster dose. The study found that being fully vaccinated with one of the mRNA vaccines provides people with a strong and broad response., Supplemental vaccinations will be recorded the same way all Covid-19 vaccinations are, Bobba said. , \"These get entered into the system, just like other doses have as well, and the patients that have gotten them will be followed, just as others (who) have gotten the vaccines throughout the country have continued to be followed,\" Bobba said. , Each vaccine site in the city will choose how to proceed with the accommodation, but \"the expectation is that they have had a discussion with a health care provider when they come in,\" Bobba said. , The mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna require two doses for full immunization.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/03/health/san-francisco-supplemental-jj-covid-vaccine-booster/index.html',1,356),(262,'US planning to expand coronavirus testing, Fauci says','Coronavirus testing in the United States is down from where is has been at previous points in the pandemic.

In a discussion on Tuesday hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said there are plans to expand testing capacity in the United States, and that research is ongoing into improving test access.  , In a briefing by the White House Covid-19 Response Team on Monday, White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said the federal government has communicated to states that it is prepared to help increase testing capacity.  , \"Last week we reiterated to all governors that we stand ready to help them in meeting this moment, whether that be through more testing, increasing treatments, vaccine access and uptake, or other state-specific needs,\" he said.  , The 7-day average of new tests is now just over 584,000 per day, down from over 1.5 million per day six months ago and about 900,000 per day a year ago, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.  , Dr. Patrick Godbey, president of the College of American Pathologists, agreed that there is a need for greater testing.   , \"I think more testing is a good thing, for many reasons. One of the important things to remember is, first of all, bad data is worse than no data at all,\" Godbey told CNN.  , \"When we talk about testing, we need to remember that all testing is not created equal. And we need to have reliable, accurate testing. That\'s always been, and continues to be, fundamental in dealing with this pandemic. The basic question is, do you have it or not? Only good testing can answer that question.\" , Testing at this stage of the pandemic takes many forms, including at-home tests performed alone or with a virtual aide, or a test administered by a doctor or pharmacist. The \"gold standard\" of Covid-19 tests is an rt-PCR test, a type of nucleic acid amplification test, which detects viral RNA. , PCR tests are what the CDC uses to assess community positivity rates, or the percent of positive tests in a community, which is typically a county. , \"A person\'s risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection is directly related to the risk for exposure to infectious persons, which is largely determined by the extent of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the surrounding community,\" the CDC said in its latest guidelines for Covid-19 prevention strategies. , The agency uses the percentage of positive PCR tests in an area combined with the weekly number of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people to assign communities a transmission level ranging from low to high. Transmissions levels then feed into decisions about Covid-19 mitigation efforts in an area. , PCR tests are also what Godbey would get in a scenario where he is a vaccinated person worried he\'s been exposed to Covid-19. , \"I would like nucleic acid amplification test. I would like it performed in a laboratory close to home so that I can get the results quickly,\" he said. , Under guidelines released last week from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people vaccinated against Covid-19 should be tested three to five days following \"a known exposure\" to the virus. The guidance is a change from the agency\'s previous recommendation that vaccinated people don\'t need be tested for Covid-19 following exposure unless they became symptomatic.  , \"The advantage in getting a vaccine is to keep you from getting severely ill. It doesn\'t mean that you can\'t harbor the virus for some time. And in order to keep the spread down, it\'s still important for you to be tested,\" Godbey said. , Godbey said some available testing options, like over-the-counter tests which a person performs themselves, may present accuracy issues. To get an accurate result, the person getting the test would need to follow the directions \"meticulously,\" and even then, environmental factors can get in the way.  , \"If you buy it, and you put it in your car in Atlanta and then leave it in the car for a while, it gets to be over 100 degrees in the car. That can affect the accuracy of the test. The ones that you have to send away, you have to be careful about how they\'re shipped,\" he said.

To make that happen, we need everyone\'s cooperation, especially the handful of countries and companies that control the global supply of vaccines,\"  he said. , \"Even while hundreds of millions of people are still waiting for their first dose, some rich countries are moving towards booster doses,\" added Tedros. \"So far more than 4 billion vaccine doses have been administered globally. More than 80% have gone to high and upper middle income countries, even though they account for less than half of the world\'s population.\" , Germany, the UK, and Israel have all announced plans to provide booster shots for certain vulnerable populations. , While Tedros said he understood the concern of all governments to protect their people from the Delta variant, \"we cannot and we should not accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it while the world\'s most vulnerable people remain unprotected.\" , In May, Tedros called for global support to enable countries to vaccinate at least 10% of their populations by September. He said that although it\'s more than halfway to the target date, the world is not on track. , When his challenge was issued, high income countries had administered around 50 doses for every 100 people, Tedros said. , Since then, the number has doubled, with high income countries having now administered almost 100 doses for every 100 people, while low income countries have been able to administer 1.5 doses for every 100 people due to lack of supply. , \"We need an urgent reversal from the majority of vaccines going to high income countries to the majority going to low income countries,\" Tedros said.  , Tedros called upon the G20 leaders to make concrete commitments to support WHO\'s global vaccination targets, for vaccine producers to prioritize COVAX, and for everyone with influence to support the call for the moratorium on boosters.

At an age when they most need to connect with peers, they\'ve had fewer opportunities to practice social skills., While I\'ve yet to meet parents who can shield their children from social setbacks, caregivers can validate children\'s suffering and help restore their optimism and sense of agency. , Here are four of the most common complaints I hear from tweens  and the ways adults can help them reframe and recover., 1. Reframing lost friendships, Your child: , \"How can I make him be my friend again? We were best friends last year!\", The parent\'s reframe: , One seventh grader may be playing with Legos while another is having crushes. Research shows only one-third of friendships stay stable from the beginning to the end of the first year of middle school, partly because of maturity differences. , I often share this statistic with tweens and explain that this is when kids are learning how to choose a friend. But even if they understand the rejection isn\'t personal, it\'s still heartbreaking. , , \"If only there were interpersonal airbags for those collisions when a friendship crashes and burns,\" Ned Johnson, co-author of \"What Do You Say?: How to Talk With Kids to Build Motivation, Stress Tolerance, and a Happy Home,\" told me. , What can you do to help? You can normalize children\'s grieving, prompt them to think about a time they distanced themselves from someone they outgrew and help them formulate a plan. ,  \"If the child is too upset to be reflective, the first step might be dealing with their sadness,\" said Martin Reeves, the co-author of  \"The Imagination Machine: How to Spark New Ideas and Create Your Company\'s Future\" and chairman of the BCG Henderson Institute. \"The second step might be to seek advice from their friend.\" , Loosen up their thinking, Reeves suggests., You might ask things such as: Why is this friendship important to you? Does this person make you feel better or worse about yourself?, Help them realize that no one friend can meet their needs with questions such as: Which friend makes you laugh? Which one is best at keeping a secret? Which one may not be great at keeping a secret but always cheers you up? , If they need emotional distance to see a problem clearly, Reeves suggests saying, \"If 10 people observed the situation, what would they see?\" , 2. Reframing shyness and social anxiety, Your child: , \"I\'m so awkward and can\'t talk to anyone! It\'s so embarrassing!\", The parent\'s reframe: , Some kids are more awkward than others, but I\'ve yet to meet a middle-schooler who doesn\'t worry about being judged. That insecurity can interfere with taking social risks., , Remind them that \"every single other kid in middle school has the same fears, anxieties and insecurities, even if it doesn\'t look like they do,\" said developmental psychologist Jeannine Jannot, author of \"The Disintegrating Student: Struggling But Smart, Falling Apart, and How to Turn it Around.\" , Jannot suggests saying, \"While you\'re ruminating about something you perceive as embarrassing, the other kids are thinking about themselves.\", Share strategies with your children that work for you, whether you ask people questions about themselves, look for common interests or make small talk before extending a formal invitation., Tweens who tend to make comments that fall flat or strike the wrong note may need help \"reading the room.\" Explain that if they\'re talking to someone who stops making eye contact, for instance, that person may have lost interest in the topic., They\'ll also have an easier time connecting with others if they\'re tuned into what\'s happening inside their bodies, said Annie Murphy Paul, a science writer and the author of \"The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain.\" , \"When speaking with someone face-to-face, we subconsciously mimic their demeanor, and that\'s how we get a sense of how someone is feeling,\" she explained., , 3. Reframing misplaced trust, Your child: , \"I can\'t believe I wasted so much time being a good friend to them when they\'re so mean to me.\", The parent\'s reframe: , The more optimistic and giving the tween, the harder it is for them to walk away from an unbalanced friendship. Instead of focusing on the misplaced trust, praise their hopefulness and reassure them that generosity typically will lead to right-fit friends. , One father, Rob Nelson of Portland, Oregon, said he tells his twin teens, \"l\'m proud of you for giving a dubious friend the benefit of the doubt for as long as you did.\" , If your child is anxious, they may want to \"fix\" the friendship right away, even if that means taking the blame for someone else\'s poor behavior. , You can dampen their stress response systems by \"taking what they\'re experiencing out of their body and putting it in a container that\'s outside of them,\" said Lori Desautels, the author of \"Connections Over Compliance, Rewiring our Perceptions of Discipline,\" and an assistant professor in the College of Education at Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana. , Have them fill a jar with sensation words such as teary, wobbly or tense, and sensation objects such as pine cones and cotton balls. \"One student put the word \"sharp\" and an eraser in their jar and explained, \'I feel like I\'ve been erased today,\' \" Desautels said. , If they\'re upset that they invested in a doomed friendship, point out that the friend was a vehicle for their own self-discovery and an opportunity to reflect on what they need and deserve from their friends., 4. Reframing social mistakes, Your child:, \"I messed up. I was angry, but I shouldn\'t have told everyone her secret.\", The parent\'s reframe: , When tweens make mistakes, they need to know they\'re not a bad person. , Explain that their prefrontal cortex -- the part of the brain associated with empathy and problem-solving -- isn\'t fully developed. As Desautels explained, \"There\'s a huge void that\'s happening because the brain is pruning away what it no longer needs as it prepares for young adulthood.\" , , , Reframe your child\'s regret and guilt in a way that highlights what matters to them, said psychologist Jelena Kecmanovic, the founder and director of Arlington/DC Behavior Therapy Institute. , Parents can say, \"If you\'re remorseful and sad because a rumor you started ended up hurting several people, that means you really care about your friends and classmates -- and that\'s really important,\" Kecmanovic said. \"Let\'s figure out how you can improve your behavior so that you don\'t hurt them again.\" , You don\'t want them to get stuck in a spiral of self-blame and shame, Kecmanovic added, \"because prolonged rumination is often an obstacle to learning from one\'s mistakes.\" , Talk about how they can make amends and put safeguards in place to prevent more mistakes, such as removing devices from their bedroom or using a calm-down strategy when they\'re angry. They can\'t banish an uncomfortable feeling, but they can control what they do with that feeling. , Whether children are the aggressor or the target, approach them with curiosity rather than judgment, and remember that they\'re still learning. , As Desautels said, \"We tend to think that once my child is in fifth or sixth grade, they should know better -- that they\'re little adults -- but this is a big misunderstanding in middle school.\" ','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/04/health/help-teen-tweens-with-social-setbacks-wellness/index.html',1,359),(265,'The unvaccinated still think Covid vaccines are a risk, survey finds','Just over half of Americans who remain unvaccinated against Covid-19 still believe the vaccine is more dangerous than the coronavirus -- despite Unvaccinated adults still also largely believe the news media have exaggerated the severity of the pandemic, and are less likely than vaccinated adults to wear a mask in public, according to the ongoing Kaiser Family Foundation survey., The health-focused nonprofit group surveyed 1,500 US adults between July 15 and 27 for this chapter of its survey, and found little change among those with the most hardened attitudes about vaccination. About 14% of those surveyed say they will \"definitely not\" get vaccinated -- the same proportion as in December., , , \"Among those who say they will \'definitely not\' get a vaccine, 75% say the news is exaggerated. The sharply different views of the vaccinated and unvaccinated help to explain the contentiousness of ongoing policy debates about vaccine mandates,\" KFF said in its report., Only 23% of adults who have yet to get vaccinated say they believe vaccines are very or extremely effective at preventing death -- despite strong evidence that they are., \"A narrow majority (53%) of unvaccinated adults believe the vaccine poses a bigger risk to their health than COVID-19 itself,\" Kaiser said. \"In contrast, an overwhelming majority (88%) of vaccinated adults say that getting infected with COVID-19 is a bigger risk to their health than the vaccine.\", \"The increase in COVID-19 cases and news of the Delta variant spreading in the U.S. has made some people say they are more likely to wear a mask in public or avoid large gatherings, though this is mainly driven by vaccinated adults,\" KFF said., \"Seeing their friends get sick and local hospitals fill up again with COVID patients may speed them along and add to their ranks,\" KFF President and CEO Drew Altman said in a statement., , , The survey found 57% unvaccinated people said news media have \"generally exaggerated\" the pandemic\'s impact, while three-fourths of vaccinated adults say media have been \"generally correct\" (53%) or even \"underestimated\" its severity (24%). , Among vaccinated adults, 53% say they wear masks in grocery stores and other indoor places, compared to 44% of unvaccinated adults., \"These differences are to a large degree driven by unvaccinated Republicans. Majorities of Republicans say they \'never\' wear a mask outdoors in crowded outdoor places, at work, or in a grocery store,\" KFF said., A quarter of unvaccinated people -- 8% of all adults --  say they are likely to get vaccinated by the end of the year. , , , But 10% of adults who remain unvaccinated say they want to \"wait and see\" how the vaccine works for other people before getting vaccinated. Another 3% say they will be immunized \"only if required.\" But that\'s down from 6% in June., The survey found people divided on whether the federal government should recommend employers require vaccines among their employees. Half said the federal government should recommend employers require staff to get the COVID-19 vaccine unless they have a medical exception., , Three quarters of Democrats support a mandate for federal employees, while two-thirds of Republicans oppose the idea.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/04/health/kaiser-poll-vaccines-aug4/index.html',1,360),(266,'Here\'s how to keep your kids safe from the coronavirus Delta variant','The more contagious Delta variant is spreading fast across the US, but children under 12 cannot get the best protection there is -- a vaccine.Nonetheless, pediatricians say there are still easy things parents can do to keep help kids safe from Covid-19, particularly as they go back to school., The variant is capable of \'causing serious injury\' to kids, Severe cases aren\'t common among kids, but Covid-19 numbers are higher than any time in the pandemic since November, said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, chief of the division of infectious diseases in the Department of Pediatrics at Stanford Medicine and a committee chair with the American Academy of Pediatrics. , Her association has been tracking cases and found nearly 72,000 children and teens caught Covid-19 last week. This is a substantial increase from the week before, about five times as many kids who were sick than at the end of June., , \"It\'s clear that this variant is capable of causing serious injury in children. You heard those stories coming out of Louisiana pediatric ICUs where there are kids as young as a few months old that are sick,\" Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, told CNN\'s John Berman on New Day Tuesday. , \"Anyone that says you don\'t have to worry about it if you are a young healthy person, you do need to think about it.\", The vaccine, The number one thing parents need to think about, pediatricians say, is the vaccine., If a parent, or adult in a child\'s life isn\'t vaccinated yet, get one now, they advise. The same goes for siblings who are old enough. , Parents should also talk to children about why it\'s important., \"Make sure you\'re having that conversation with them -- about why it is important to be vaccinated and how it protects not only them but all those around them,\" said Dr. Dane Snyder, section chief of primary care pediatrics at Nationwide Children\'s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.  , , Parents may also want talk to anyone interacting with the child about their vaccination status, Maldonado said. If the person isn\'t vaccinated, and the parent still feels OK about having them around their unvaccinated child, at least ask them to wear a mask or even consider asking them to get a test before getting together. , \"You wouldn\'t want your child in a car where someone was driving without seat belts or without a driver\'s license,\" Maldonado said. \"We shouldn\'t be afraid to stand up for our children\'s health.\", Good hygiene , Snyder said parents should also continue to reinforce the message about good hygiene., For instance, he said, parents should teach kids to cough into their elbows and wash those hands., \"Really, handwashing is one of the number one most effective ways to help prevent the spread of any kind of disease, whether at home or in the community,\" Snyder said., Masks and distance, Three feet of physical distance can reduce the spread of the virus, good ventilation helps, and masks for indoor activity are key, public health experts say., The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends everyone older than age 2 wear a mask, regardless of vaccination status, when they go to school. , \"The data are very strong that masking continues to be a very effective way to prevent infection,\" said Dr. Larry Kociolek, attending physician, infectious disease at Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children\'s Hospital of Chicago. , By some estimates, a mask reduces the risk of catching Covid-19 by about 50% he said. \"Masks are most effective in areas where risk of exposure and transmission is high,\" Kociolek said., , Dr. Sarah Combs, an emergency medicine physician with Children\'s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., said parents can make wearing a mask fun. , \"Go ahead and get them a mask with their favorite character and tell them it\'s like Superman\'s mask. Do whatever you can to engage them, especially the younger ones who have less comprehension,\" Combs said., Snyder recommends parents talk with their kids about wearing a mask at school so that they know what to expect, particularly if a mask isn\'t required. \"Make sure you\'re talking to children about assuming things about kids who either are, or are not masked,\" Snyder said., As for parents and masks, Dr. Amy Edwards, the associate medical director of Pediatric Infection Control at UH Rainbow Babies and Children\'s Hospital in Cleveland, suggests even parents who are vaccinated should wear a mask whenever out in public. \"That way they will be less likely to contract Covid and bring it home,\" said Edwards. , Outside time, The risk of catching Covid-19 is much lower if the child is playing outdoors.  , Edwards said she limits her own kids to outdoor play only with their friends. \"It\'s fine to play with the neighbors\' kids, but only outside in the yard, not inside in the playroom or in the bedroom or anything like that, where there is closer indoor contact -- which is a bigger problem,\" she said., With older kids who like video games, Edwards said a parent could set up time for them to stream together, even if they are in different rooms. , , \"Try to think of creative ways that kids can play together but limit their exposure,\" Edwards said., There\'s an added benefit to outside play. \"It\'s not only safer from a Covid-19 standpoint -- physical activity is a real benefit to their health,\" Kociolek said, especially in light of rising child obesity rates in the Chicago area since the pandemic started., Talk to your children, Conversations with kids about Covid-19 are essential, pediatricians say. Kids are like sponges, Combs said. , \"Even at that very young age they pick up on their environment, they pick up on your emotional cues. And if we try and keep things from kids, they get more suspicious and more anxious,\" Combs said., So even a toddler can understand the basics., , Edwards says she\'s even talked to her children, ages 2 and 4, about the Delta variant. \"I\'ve told them the virus kind of grew up and has gotten a little bit stronger, so we have to fight a little bit harder,\" Edwards said. , With teens, parents don\'t want to make them more anxious, so be matter of fact about it, Combs said. It may help to acknowledge it can be scary, even for parents. \"That\'s OK, because we know of things and ways to lessen the risk and to help all of us in the family keep safe,\" Combs said. , Combs added it\'s also good to encourage the kids to be open, especially if they are not feeling well, so that parents can keep them home and remind the child that staying home isn\'t a punishment -- it is to keep people safe. , , Edwards said clear communication and reassurance are important with kids., \"How many times did we tell our parents growing up, \'this is not fair,\' and our parents would tell us \'life is not fair?\'\" Edwards said. \"For kids, this pandemic is the ultimate \'life is not fair.\' We need to let them know we are doing whatever we can to help them.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/04/health/covid-19-kids-parent-advice-delta-variant/index.html',1,361),(267,'Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Think you don\'t want to get vaccinated? Think again','I still remember the feeling I had on December 13, 2020 -- the date the first vaccines rolled out of the Pfizer facility in Michigan, destined for hospitals and vaccination centers in every state in the country. Typically reserved scientists described it as the \"medical moonshot\" we had all been waiting for: a powerful tool against the new virus that had paralyzed the world for almost a year. Those first doses shipped out across America were supposed to signal the next phase of this pandemic -- and it felt as if the whole country could soon let out a collective sigh of relief.As I waited to get my first shot, I remember thinking how completely ordinary, and how completely extraordinary, it was all at the same time. Here was a snippet of messenger RNA from the virus, delicately wrapped in a little lipid envelope and delivered to each of our bodies via two shots, spaced a few weeks apart. This mRNA would prompt each of us to manufacture a little piece of the coronavirus (the spike protein) which would in turn prompt our immune system (our body\'s defense mechanism) to create antibodies and other immune cells in response., While the vaccines seemed to be created within months, whereas they normally take years, the technology behind this vaccine was actually the culmination of a couple of decades of work by some of the most brilliant minds in science and medicine. It quickly became clear the vaccines worked extraordinarily well and have the potential to truly revolutionize medicine beyond this pandemic., I kept reflecting how this moment could be a turning point -- the beginning of the end of the pandemic; light at the end of a very long, devastating tunnel., The more things change, the more they stay the same, Eight months ago, while I was waiting for my turn to get the shot, the headlines were about the surging numbers of cases, hospitals buckling under pressure, dire predictions for more of the same in the months to come, and the politics of mask wearing., Today, I\'m heartbroken to read the same headlines: case numbers climbing, hospitals in some places inundated with patients, predictions of \"the worst is yet to come,\" and cries against mask mandates. And this time, vaccine mandates, too., I want to be clear: This was not inevitable. Even without vaccines, the country became far sicker than it should have. The vaccines were supposed to wrap us with near-impenetrable armor and provide longer lasting protection. Of course, armor only works if you wear it, and the same is true of vaccines., If you look at the map, the five states with the highest percentage of new cases in the US are Florida, Texas, California, Louisiana and Georgia. Almost one in every five new cases of coronavirus -- 19.2% -- are from Florida alone, yet the state only has 6.5% of the US population. All of those states, except California, have fewer than 50% of their populations fully vaccinated., Among the states with some of the lowest rates of new cases per 100,000 people, you\'ll find many of them have among the highest rates of vaccination in the country, such as Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine and Maryland., President Joe Biden\'s chief medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and others warned this great vaccination divide would cleave the country in half, especially when coupled with the very transmissible Delta variant that has been sweeping the country., \"When you have such a low level of vaccination superimposed upon a variant that has a high degree of efficiency of spread, what you are going to see among under-vaccinated regions -- be that states, cities or counties -- you\'re going to see these individual types of blips. It\'s almost like it\'s going to be two Americas,\" Fauci predicted on CNN at the end of June., \"You\'re going to have areas where the vaccine rate is high, where more than 70% of the population has received at least one dose. When you compare that with areas where you may have 35% of the people vaccinated, you clearly have a high risk of seeing these spikes in those selected areas,\" he said.,  Fauci called the situation \"entirely avoidable, entirely preventable.\", Vaccines protect us from getting sick, Despite the latest news and research -- showing that even among people who are vaccinated, there is some risk of getting infected with the coronavirus -- the most recent data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows only about 6,600 breakthrough cases were severe out of more than 163 million fully vaccinated people, and more than a quarter of those were classified as \"asymptomatic or not related to Covid-19.\" Put another way: More than 99.99% of people who are fully vaccinated have not had a breakthrough case resulting in hospitalization or death. And yes, that\'s even taking into account the more transmissible Delta variant., There is some good news. The pace of vaccination is picking up across the country. An average of 681,373 doses are reported administered each day, according to the CDC\'s latest data. That includes an average of 446,300 people getting their first shot each day -- a 24% increase over last week and the highest it\'s been since July 4., Worst to first, The vaccination rate is picking up even in states where residents have been more reluctant to get vaccinated. For example, Louisiana, where just 37% of the population is fully vaccinated -- and which had the most new cases per capita last week -- saw daily vaccination rates rise 111% compared to three weeks ago. The state ranks 47th overall for the share of the population with at least one dose of vaccine, but last week ranked first in new vaccinations per 100,000 residents. Alabama, whose average more than doubled from three weeks ago, ranks 46th overall in vaccine coverage but third in last week\'s pace; and Mississippi was 50th overall but eighth last week., \"This may be a tipping point for those who have been hesitant to say, \'Okay, it\'s time.\' I hope that\'s what\'s happening,\" National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said Sunday on CNN\'s \"State of the Union.\", \"That\'s what desperately needs to happen if we\'re going to get this Delta variant put back in its place.\", But we still have to do better if we want to get this pandemic under control. Our average of 446,300 people getting their first shot each day is still well below our peak in mid-April, when an average of nearly 2 million people were doing so. As things stand now, there are about 140 million people in this country who have still not even gotten one shot, and of that, more than 90 million are age 12 and older and thus eligible to be vaccinated., If we had maintained the vaccination pace of early spring, the entire eligible population would\'ve gotten at least one shot by now. It didn\'t happen, despite the widespread availability and zero cost. Having just returned from Japan, where only 30% of people are vaccinated, I was reminded just how scarce -- therefore valued -- these vaccines are around the world. In India, just 7.5% of the population is fully vaccinated. In many African countries that number is less than 5%, and in Haiti, it\'s less than 1%., Where\'s the rub?, So, now that a remarkable feat of science has been created, we have to address the obstacles that prevent it from having its maximal benefit. In many other countries, it is access, but in the United States, it is hesitancy, which comes in all sorts of different forms. We have to combat vaccine hesitancy -- an issue as old as vaccines themselves, the first instances appearing soon after the first vaccines were popularized in the 1800s., According to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll released in mid-July, concerns about side effects, the newness of the vaccine, and perceptions about not needing to get vaccinated were among the top reasons people gave for not getting their shot., So, let me try and address these one by one. These are the same conversations I have been having with my own neighbors and friends., As far as safety goes, more than 4 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered worldwide. In the United States alone, more than 347 million doses have been administered., These are some of the widely used medical products on the planet, and as a result there is a remarkable amount of real world data., Throughout the vaccination campaigns, the number of side effects have been and remain consistently and extraordinarily low. The CDC is constantly searching for side effects. That is how the agency was able to confirm 28 cases of rare blood clots among the 8.7 million doses of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine administered in the US. The side effect monitoring system is very sensitive and the news has been good. Overall, side effects have been minuscule., What is not minuscule is the number of deaths caused by Covid-19: more than 4.2 million deaths worldwide, including more than 610,000 here in the United States., As for the newness of the vaccine, and the fact that the ones here in this country are not fully approved -- simply \"authorized\" -- by the US Food and Drug Administration, the agency has said it is working as fast as possible to get that done. But it is a complicated and time-dependent process that, until recently, used to take more than a decade to complete., To give an emergency use authorization, the FDA had asked for two months of data, whereas for full approval the agency requires six months\' worth. There is also a review of manufacturing facilities and even discussion about how it will be marketed in the future. It adds layers of complexity that can be agonizingly slow, but may also provide a layer of confidence in the process., \"I can\'t speak to a date when we intend to have this done. But what I can say is we are going to move with all due diligence to get the review done with our usual high quality, as rapidly as we can,\" Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA\'s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told The Washington Post on Friday., \"We know how important it is for people to be able to get vaccinated. We know that there are students going back to college who would like to see a licensed vaccine before they get vaccinated. And we understand that, and we will work toward getting this across the finish line as rapidly as possible,\" he said., The last of the top three reasons for not getting vaccinated -- perceptions about not needing the vaccine -- might be the trickiest to tackle, although it shouldn\'t be because the statistics are stark., Covid-19 is a disease that wasn\'t known to us 20 months ago, but still became a leading cause of death in the US last year. Its closest competitor, heart disease, doesn\'t have a vaccine to prevent it, but Covid-19 does., And even though millions of people in the US have become infected with the coronavirus, and hundreds of thousands have died of Covid-19, there are still many pockets of the country where people feel they escaped the worst of the pandemic and no longer need to worry, or that they never had to worry in the first place., But the Delta variant has changed that calculation. Delta is unforgiving and will take advantage of even a quick chance encounter to infect., If you look at the data, the death rates and hospitalizations have plummeted over this spring and summer, but that is only part of the story. If you dig a bit deeper, there are alarming trends. According to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, of about half the states (those that provided data), more than 95% of hospitalizations and deaths have been among unvaccinated people. That number now includes young and formerly healthy people, not just older Americans and those with underlying health conditions., The country is no longer being split into vaccinated and unvaccinated. It will quite simply be divided between vaccinated and infected. It is also why masks will once again be commonplace for a time. As we hopefully continue to increase vaccination rates, we want to simultaneously hit the brakes on viral transmission, and masks in high-risk areas are the most effective way to accomplish that; masks, to help us bring viral transmission to low levels around the country, and high levels of vaccination to keep us there., One of the most common questions about the vaccine: What if I previously had Covid-19? It is a very fair question, and there is plenty of evidence showing that natural infection can provide good immunity. I want to be clear before I continue: By now you must realize that achieving immunity by naturally getting infected is a terrible idea and could land you in the hospital or worse. Vaccination is an exponentially safer way to achieve immunity. But, the question you are likely asking is more nuanced: Do you still need a vaccine if you already had Covid-19?, The official guidance from the CDC is yes. And, here is why. Existing data provides evidence that the vaccine will provide more durable immunity, and may also be protective against future variants., These are always critically important metrics, and even more so now, as we deal with the Delta variant. Again, this isn\'t dismissing the immunity from a previous Covid-19 infection, but making the case that adding a vaccine will provide better protection going forward. While the United States recommends a full two-dose course of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, some countries have recommended getting at least one shot in those with previously known Covid infections. The rationale is the original infection provided the same initial immunity as the first shot of a vaccine, and then a second shot would act as a powerful booster., These are the real discussions I have been having with friends and colleagues and I know winning over people in this last camp may be the most difficult of all, because it does involve conversation -- possibly a series of ongoing conversations -- with loved ones, friends and perhaps a personal physician or trusted pastor, who can talk to the hesitant or reluctant person in a way that resonates with them personally. And victory will be hard won, measured one person at a time., I try to do it all the time. For example, as I walk through my daily life, as an on-air correspondent, as a doctor, and in this space. I do it not only because I love my family, but because I love yours, as well.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/04/health/covid-vaccine-hesitancy-gupta/index.html',1,362),(268,'Here\'s how schools should handle a Covid-19 outbreak, experts say','Getting children back in classrooms has been a top priority for the United States -- but if a coronavirus outbreak were to happen within a school, how should schools respond?, Drew Charter School in Atlanta kicked off the new school year last week and already has reported initially nine students and five staff testing positive for Covid-19, and more than 100 students at the school are in quarantine, Peter McKnight, the head of the school, said Friday. Only one of the five staff members who tested positive had been vaccinated, he said., The school initially informed parents in a letter Thursday that two staff members and a student had tested positive. , The school said it was \"working closely with local public health officials to ensure we follow the proper recommendations to quarantine.\", On Friday afternoon, McKnight revised the number of positive cases in a statement and said discussions about a staff vaccination mandate were underway., Health departments may step in, Institutions must respond quickly -- with contact tracing, testing, the quarantining of people who were exposed to the virus and the isolation of people with infections, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told CNN., , \"The first thing that would happen -- or one of the very first things -- is that you would notify the health department,\" Schaffner, who is not associated with the Drew Charter School, said about a potential outbreak., \"They likely would do a fair amount of testing,\" Schaffner said., \"The larger community would find out what was going on, and that there was a response to provide some reassurance in that regard,\" he said. \"And in this context, a local health department may actually get some help from the state health department -- send in personnel and other health department folks who could help with the testing, or perform the testing.\", , Overall, testing would play a big role in responding to an outbreak -- as well as local health departments., Some schools may turn to certain resources -- such as the online tool whentotest.org, which is supported by the National Institutes of Health\'s RADx Tech program -- to help with implementing an effective Covid-19 testing program for their institution to either prevent or respond to an outbreak., At Drew Charter School in Atlanta, five Covid-19 cases were detected before the start of the school year on Tuesday following the testing of about 1,900 students and staff, according to McKnight, the head of the school. All staff and employees are tested weekly, and students are highly encouraged to also participate in weekly testing through the school., , \"The best way to contain outbreaks that do occur in schools is to detect them early so that you can stop the outbreak before it becomes widespread. The goal is to prevent disease with the least disruption to education,\" Dr. Andrew Pavia, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah, wrote in an email to CNN., If an outbreak is confined to a classroom or team, people who had \"significant exposure\" initially may quarantine but \"that does not necessarily include everyone if masks are worn at all times and there is adequate distancing which limits exposure,\" Pavia wrote., Whether masks and other mitigation measures are required or enforced in schools varies across states and school districts. At Drew Charter in Atlanta, for instance, all staff and students are required to use their masks at all times, except when eating or drinking. , , \"We now have the knowledge and the tools to prevent most school outbreaks, and those schools that use them are likely to do well. Sadly though, the trend in many jurisdictions seems to be not to use these effective tools to allow safe in-person learning,\" Pavia wrote in his email. , \"The least desirable approach is to close the entire school for 10 days and use testing to allow return to learning,\" he wrote. \"But, if safety measures are not in place before the outbreak, it may spread rapidly and that may be your only tool.\", Those who were exposed to the virus and tested would have to quarantine until their results determine whether they have Covid-19, and if they do, they would need to isolate until they are no longer infectious., , For instance, \"when we are aware that an individual has Covid, they are required to have a 10-day break from school to be able to return when they\'re symptom-free, when they\'ve had a negative test or 10 days after that positive test,\" Mark Lane, superintendent of Decorah Community School District in Iowa, where state law blocks mask mandates in schools, told CNN\'s Victor Blackwell last week. , However, again, rules can vary across districts., Lane said if students are in quarantine the school will offer virtual supports. He said students and families are not required to disclose if someone in their household has Covid-19 -- but they are encouraged to stay home from school if they experience symptoms., Outbreak plans vary \'state to state and school district to school district\', In Tennessee, Metro Nashville Public Schools will follow the same protocol that was followed last year for Covid-19 cases, Sean Braisted, a spokesperson for Metro Nashville Public Schools, told CNN in an email., , \"Metro Nashville Public Schools partners with the Metro Public Health Department for our school nurse program. As they did last year, school nurses will conduct contact tracing in the event a student tests positive for COVID-19 and those students or staff who are unvaccinated and deemed to be a close contact will quarantine based on CDC guidelines,\" Braisted wrote. , \"Students who are required to quarantine or self-isolate will have the opportunity to do class work remotely and receive online assistance through our MNPS Virtual School in order to be counted present for the school day.\", In Colorado, the nursing and student health services team at Denver Public Schools is still developing plans and protocols with help from local health officials for the upcoming school year, Will Jones, a spokesperson for the school district, told CNN in an email last week., , Seattle Public Schools in Washington has Covid-19 site supervisors in place to help identify the close contacts of a Covid-19 case within a school, Tim Robinson, a spokesperson for the district, wrote in an email to CNN. , The school district\'s protocol includes contacting people who may have been exposed, providing recommendations on testing and remaining in quarantine, and consulting with public health officials, among other steps., Outbreak response plans can vary state by state and school district by school district, Kim Anderson, executive director of the National Education Association, told CNN., \"From what we understand, it does depend on what district you are in. The district should have very well thought-out outbreak plans that have included the voices of educators and parents and community members in the crafting of those plans, and they should have plans that follow the CDC recommendations,\" Anderson said. , \"Our recommendation to all students and school districts is to follow the medical experts and follow the CDC. Follow what the medical experts are telling us is the pathway to keeping our students and our educators and our community safe,\" she said. \"But in reality, it does vary from state to state and school district to school district.\", What the CDC recommends, With an internal CDC document revealing on Thursday night just how easily the highly contagious Delta variant can spread among both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, there has been renewed focus on what plans schools have in place in case of a potential outbreak., , The document notes that the Delta variant can be as transmissible as chickenpox and one infected person could spread the variant to about five to nine other people on average -- whereas, with the original strain of the coronavirus, one infected person could spread it to two to three people on average., Given new evidence on the variant, CDC updated its guidance for fully vaccinated people last week, recommending that all teachers, staff, students, and visitors to K-12 schools wear masks indoors, regardless of their vaccination status. , \"Children should return to full-time in-person learning in the fall with layered prevention strategies in place,\" says the CDC\'s guidance for K-12 schools. \"Though Covid-19 outbreaks have occurred in school settings, multiple studies have shown that transmission rates within school settings, when multiple prevention strategies are in place, are typically lower than -- or similar to -- community transmission levels.\" , , The guidance adds that parents or other caregivers should report when a child is newly diagnosed with coronavirus infection., If a Covid-19 case is confirmed, the CDC notes that schools can help public health officials determine which close contacts and others exposed to the infected person should be tested and quarantined. , The CDC also offers a Covid-19 diagnosis flowchart detailing what to do if a student becomes sick or reports a new Covid-19 diagnosis at school, and the agency notes that the ill student can return to school and end isolation once there has been 10 days since the start of their symptoms, they have been fever-free for a day without the use of fever-reducing medication and their symptoms have improved., , The steps needed to control a Covid-19 outbreak within a school would be similar to steps taken for any outbreak of a communicable disease in a school, such as measles, Schaffner said., One significant difference is that across all 50 states, measles vaccinations are among the routine childhood vaccines generally required in public schools. However, most schools do not require coronavirus vaccinations -- and some states even block schools from making such mandates., A CNN analysis has found that, as of last week, at least nine states -- Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Montana, Ohio, Oklahoma and Utah -- have enacted legislation this year that would restrict public schools and universities from requiring either coronavirus vaccination or documentation of vaccination status., , Once vaccinations were required for measles, \"transmission in schools absolutely stopped, and then it went down to zero,\" Schaffner said, adding that when it comes to coronavirus vaccines, \"it\'s so important for children older than 12 -- they are the ones currently eligible for vaccine -- to be vaccinated.\", A CNN analysis found last month that fewer than a third of 12- to 17-year-olds are on track to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 in the next two weeks., \"We don\'t have the number of individuals vaccinated that are needed in order to control Covid,\" Dr. Tina Tan, a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University\'s Feinberg School of Medicine and a board member for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, told CNN on Monday. She added that\'s why the same protocols to respond to outbreaks before vaccinations became available should be followed now, even after vaccinations have become available., \'School outbreaks seem inevitable\', There is growing concern about the risk of Covid-19 outbreaks in schools this fall, as some outbreaks already have occurred in summer camps in recent months, all while the more transmissible Delta coronavirus variant continues to circulate across the United States., , A parent whose children attend Drew Charter School in Atlanta said he had anticipated positive cases given the recent rise in Covid-19 and the spread of the Delta variant. CNN agreed not to publish his family\'s surname because of the sensitivity of the situation., The timing of the positive tests was concerning, said Brandon, the parent., \"We\'re just going back,\" he said, \"so it makes you on edge.\", The parent said he would have preferred if only vaccinated students and staff had been allowed to return to school., Brandon said the school doesn\'t require teachers be vaccinated., \"I figure they shouldn\'t be in the school if they\'re not vaccinated,\" he said. \"That\'s why they should have held off until we got everything under control.\", , Brandon said his daughter learned at school Friday that classmates had been asked to quarantine. It\'s unclear if any of Brandon\'s children at Drew were in close contact with those who tested positive, but he said his children would stay home as a precaution., He said his daughter is eligible for the vaccine and expects to get the shot soon., His daughter, who left school to return home on Friday, told CNN she had been excited about the start of in-person learning because online study was challenging., \'We should be able to contain outbreaks to a minimum\', \"With the incredible contagiousness of the Delta variant, limited mask use, and low vaccination rates in some jurisdictions, school outbreaks seem inevitable,\" Pavia wrote in his email. \"I am very concerned for the impact that will have on children\'s education.\", , Other public health experts have expressed some concern as well for the communities surrounding schools, if mitigation measures are not followed., \"We can anticipate -- because of the extraordinarily contagious Delta virus and because such a large proportion of our population is still under-vaccinated -- that there will be sustained transmission of Covid, and there could well be local outbreaks,\" Schaffner said. \"I think we will see those kinds of outbreaks occur.\", As long as mitigation measures are followed, schools can reduce the risk of an outbreak even if there is a Covid-19 case in the school because masking, physical distancing and other measures will help control any spread, said Dr. Nathaniel Beers, who serves on the American Academy of Pediatrics\' Council on School Health and is president of the HSC Health Care System in Washington, DC., , The American Academy of Pediatrics released new Covid-19 guidance for schools last month that supports in-person learning and recommends universal mask use in school by everyone over the age of 2, regardless of vaccination status. , \"We will certainly see cases in schools, because there continues to be spread in the community, and so certainly, we expect that within the staff population as well as student population, there will be cases,\" Beers said. \"If schools implement the recommendations that the AAP and CDC have made ... then we should be able to contain outbreaks to a minimum.\"','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/03/health/covid-19-schools-outbreak-response-wellness/index.html',1,364),(269,'Florida and Texas had one-third of all US Covid-19 cases in past week, official says','One-third of all US The cases are mainly in areas where vaccination rates remain low, Zients said at a briefing Monday. , \"In fact, seven states with the lowest vaccination rates represent just about 8- 1/2% of the US population, but account for more than 17% of cases, and one in three cases nationwide occurred in Florida and Texas, this past week,\" Zients said., In the past two weeks, daily case rates have gone up fourfold, according to Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. , The increase comes as the Delta variant spreads and the percentage of fully vaccinated Americans hovers around 49.7%, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hospitals are once again filling up with patients as the virus tears through the unvaccinated population. , \"There are still about 90 million eligible Americans who are unvaccinated,\" Zients said. \"And we need them to do their part, roll up their sleeves and get vaccinated. Each and every shot matters.\", Vaccination rates rising with spread of Delta variant, A \"silver lining\" of the surge in Covid-19 cases caused by the Delta variant is that more Americans appear to be at the tipping point of understanding the importance of Covid-19 vaccinations, Collins said Sunday on CNN. , \"People are waking up to this,\" he said. \"That\'s what desperately needs to happen if we are going to get this Delta variant put back in its place, because right now it is having a pretty big party in the middle of the country.\" , And according to Zients, vaccination rates have more than doubled in the states with the highest case rates., \"The eight states with the highest current case rates have seen an average increase of 171% in the number of people newly vaccinated, each day over the past three weeks,\" he said., \"Louisiana has seen a 302% increase in the average number of newly vaccinated per day, Mississippi 250%, Alabama 215%, and Arkansas 206%,\" Zients said., Zients said this increase means people are understanding the risks of going unvaccinated., \"This increase in vaccination rates in states that have been lagging is a positive trend. Americans are seeing the risk and impact of being unvaccinated and responding with action. And that\'s what it\'s going to take to get us out of this pandemic,\" he said. , More than 99.99% of people fully vaccinated against Covid-19 have not had a breakthrough case resulting in hospitalization or death, according to the latest data from the CDC. , , Vaccination milestone reached -- about a month late, The US by Monday had vaccinated 70% of adults with at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, the White House\'s Covid-19 data director, Cyrus Shahpar, said on Twitter., This is the goal the Biden administration originally set for July 4, so it\'s roughly a month behind that deadline. , \"Today we hit 70% of adults w/ at least one dose! +468K doses reported administered, incl. 320K newly vaccinated (vs. 257K last Monday). 7-day average of newly vaccinated highest since July 4. Let\'s continue working to get more eligible vaccinated!\" Shahpar tweeted., The CDC reported Sunday that 816,203 additional doses were administered, the fifth straight day the agency recorded more than 700,000 shots in arms. The current seven-day average of doses administered is 662,529 per day, the highest average since July 7. , Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, attributed the increase to two likely factors: trusted leaders coming out in support of vaccines and people seeing how much better vaccinated communities are faring against the virus, he told CBS on Sunday., In Florida, where nearly 1 in 5 new Covid cases across the US are reported, chief clinical officer for AdventHealth Central Florida, Dr. Neil Finkler, said none of his patients thought they would get the virus. , \"The Delta variant has proven to be so highly contagious that even the young and the healthy, including pregnant patients, are now starting to fill up our hospitals,\" said Finkler.  , The race to get people vaccinated , Despite the rising number of Covid-19 cases, Fauci believes there is enough community protection to prevent the country from having to implement lockdown measures again, he told ABC on Sunday., \"I think we have enough of the percentage of people in the country, not enough to crush the outbreak, but I believe enough to not allow us to get into the situation we were in last winter,\" he said., But things are still likely to get worse for the unvaccinated, Fauci warned., \"We\'re looking to some pain and suffering in the future because we\'re seeing cases go up,\" he told ABC. , And while the unvaccinated will likely experience the brunt of this pain and suffering, Fauci noted the choices of the unvaccinated impact the overall community situation., \"When you have unvaccinated people getting infected, you\'re propagating the dynamics of the outbreak, which ultimately impacts everybody from the standpoint of having to wear masks, from the standpoint of the safety of kids in schools, from the standpoint of being able to open up everything the way we were when we were normal,\" he said.  , To address the overall impacts, many officials have been increasing vaccination efforts in undervaccinated communities., Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Sunday his state is seeing \"a significant increase\" in vaccination rates, particularly in rural areas., \"I think ... fear of the Delta variant is certainly one of the causes,\" DeWine told CNN on Sunday., Ohio is now focusing outreach efforts to the \"undervaccinated\" Medicaid population through incentives like $100 cash awards for getting the shot, DeWine said., The state\'s \"Vax-a-Million\" lottery program also played a major role in reversing a downward trend in vacation rates, he said., \"We think well over 100,000 extra people were vaccinated, at a minimum, because of that,\" DeWine said. \"It was very, very successful. It was something that worked and, you know, we are glad we did it.\" , Despite the state\'s progress on vaccinations, \"We have room to grow,\" DeWine said. , Hospitals overwhelmed with patients , The surge of Covid-19 patients in hospitals could have an impact on others who need medical care, doctors said. , In Austin, Texas, \"our ICU capacity is reaching a critical point where the level of risk to the entire community has significantly increased, and not just to those who are needing treatment for COVID,\" Austin-Travis County Health Authority Dr. Desmar Walkes said in a statement. , \"If we fail to come together as a community now, we jeopardize the lives of loved ones who might need critical care.\" , In Mississippi, Covid-19 hospitalizations have increased significantly -- including among younger patients, State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said. All 88 beds in the University of Mississippi Medical Center\'s intensive care unit had filled up by Friday, according to data from the state\'s health department. , And in Louisiana, \"we\'re becoming victims of the unvaccinated,\" said Dr. Christopher Thomas, a critical care physician at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge. , \"We currently are overwhelming our bed capacity. We\'re creating burnout for our teams. And honestly, we\'re beginning to impact the rest of the health care for the community.\" , The facility has 23 patients wating for a transfer into the hospital for an ICU bed, Dr. Catherine O\'Neal, the hospital\'s chief medical officer, said Monday. , \"We no longer think we\'re giving adequate care to anybody, because these are the darkest days of the pandemic.\", At the Louisiana hospital, 97% of Covid-19 patients in the ICU were unvaccinated, Thomas said. As of Friday, the average age of Covid-19 patients in the ICU was 48. , \"That means there are children -- with parents -- who are now in the hospital,\" he said. , Correction: An earlier version of this story gave the wrong timing for when the doses were administered when discussing the rate of daily vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the additional doses Sunday, but it\'s not clear when they were all administered.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/02/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html',1,365),(270,'About 99.999% of fully vaccinated Americans have not had a deadly Covid-19 breakthrough case, CDC data shows','More than 99.99% of people fully vaccinated against Covid-19 have not had a breakthrough case resulting in hospitalization or death, according to the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The data highlights what leading health experts across the country have highlighted for months: Covid-19 vaccines are very effective at preventing serious illness and death from Covid-19 and are the country\'s best shot at slowing the pandemic down and avoiding further suffering. , The CDC reported 6,587 Covid-19 breakthrough cases as of July 26, including 6,239 hospitalizations and 1,263 deaths. At that time, more than 163 million people in the United States were fully vaccinated against Covid-19. , Divide those severe breakthrough cases by the total fully vaccinated population for the result: less than 0.004% of fully vaccinated people had a breakthrough case that led to hospitalization and less than 0.001% of fully vaccinated people died from a breakthrough Covid-19 case., Most of the breakthrough cases -- about 74% -- occurred among adults 65 or older. , Since May, the CDC has focused on investigating only hospitalized or fatal Covid-19 cases among people who have been fully vaccinated. The agency says the data relies on \"passive and voluntary reporting\" and is a \"snapshot\" to \"help identify patterns and look for signals among vaccine breakthrough cases.\", \"To date, no unexpected patterns have been identified in the case demographics or vaccine characteristics among people with reported vaccine breakthrough infections,\" according to the CDC. , The agency shared a study this week that showed the Delta variant produced similar amounts of virus in vaccinated and unvaccinated people if they get infected. Experts continue to say that vaccination makes it less likely you\'ll catch Covid-19 in the first place. But for those who do, the findings suggest they could have a similar tendency to spread it as unvaccinated people. , That study also convinced CDC leaders to update the agency\'s mask guidance on Tuesday, recommending that fully vaccinated people also wear masks indoors when in areas with \"substantial\" and \"high\" Covid-19 transmission to prevent further spread of the Delta variant. Guidance for unvaccinated people remains to continue masking until they are fully vaccinated., Beyond severe cases, an analysis of official state data from the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that breakthrough cases of any kind are also extremely rare., About half of states report data on Covid-19 breakthrough cases, and in each of those states, less than 1% of fully vaccinated people had a breakthrough infection, ranging from 0.01% in Connecticut to 0.9% in Oklahoma.,  The KFF analysis also found that more than 90% of cases -- and more than 95% of hospitalizations and deaths -- have been among unvaccinated people. In most states, more than 98% of cases were among the unvaccinated., Pace of vaccinations is going up, But experts say those vaccinated, while they may be able to transmit the virus, remain very well protected against getting seriously ill. Amid the latest surge of Covid-19 cases nationwide fueled by the Delta variant, local leaders across the US are reporting that the majority of new infections and hospitalizations are among unvaccinated people. , The Delta variant is now so contagious, one former health official recently warned that people who are not protected -- either through vaccination or previous infection -- will likely get it. , Amid concerns over the rising cases and the dangerous strain, the country has seen a steady rise in the pace of vaccinations in the past three weeks -- and an even sharper increase in states that had been lagging the most, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data., The seven-day average of new doses administered in the US is now 652,084, up 26% from three weeks ago., The difference is even more striking in several southern states: Alabama\'s seven-day average of new doses administered is more than double what it was three weeks ago. The state has the lowest rate of its total population fully vaccinated in the US, at roughly 34%. , Arkansas, with just 36% of its population fully vaccinated, has also seen its average daily rate of doses administered double in the last three weeks. , Louisiana, which had by far the most new Covid-19 cases per capita last week and has only fully vaccinated 37% of its population, saw daily vaccination rates rise 111% compared to three weeks ago., Meanwhile, Missouri, which has been among the hardest-hit states in the latest Covid-19 surge, now has a daily average of new vaccinations 87% higher than three weeks ago., Roughly 57.5% of the US population has received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose and about 49.5% is fully vaccinated, CDC data shows.

And while it\'s important to have the White House and President out front in a national emergency of this magnitude, it\'s likely the near total White House domination of the response is widening the unhelpful political divides that are making it harder than it needs to be to fight coronavirus., The briefings are the most evident example., Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, give brief comments about the latest statistics, predict where the pandemic is heading, and discuss a piece of research or two that help explain the latest understanding of Covid-19.,  , Overseeing all of it is White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeff Zients. It\'s a White House sponsored event, coordinated by White House staff, and attended by political reporters as well as specialist health reporters.,  , Although the briefings follow the science -- as President Joe Biden pledged when he took office in January -- they are short and include frequent references to the federal government\'s involvement. They are deeply branded with the White House stamp. ,  , , This past week was an exception - to a degree. On Thursday, Biden spoke alone about the government\'s new push for vaccine and mask requirement., On Tuesday, Walensky released new guidance about masks -- saying even fully vaccinated people should wear masks indoors if they are in areas with significant or high levels of coronavirus transmission. She cited the science as backing the CDC decision and didn\'t mention politics., And she briefed alone, in a CDC-organized teleconference. It was the first CDC briefing that did not originate from the White House since April 23, when the CDC and US Food and Drug Administration held a joint briefing on vaccines., But by the time she spoke, the White House had already upstaged her, leaking news of the updated guidance hours before the briefing. White House officials made it clear they had taken part, if not in the actual decision to change the guidance, at least on deciding how and when to announce it., It\'s a deliberate and understandable move. The White House wants to be seen as leading an all-of-government response. , \"It was never not political,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security., ,  , Biden himself, and political appointees, are front and center. And under most circumstances, it might even be desirable to see a president flanked by science and medical advisers, leading the country through a pandemic., But in 2021, it\'s an approach that may be helping feed the deep political divisions that have characterized this pandemic like no other event in living memory., The pandemic has worsened the sense that there are two Americas -- one in which people trust what science and the federal government is telling them, and another in which people subscribe to \"alternative facts\" and reject anything that might come from the Biden administration. , There\'s little opportunity for people to accept the science without accepting that it\'s what the administration wants, too. There\'s no out for conservatives to accept the science without also accepting direction from people they see as liberals bent on ruining the country., When supporting Trump means rejecting vaccines, Thus, the same people who supported Trump are often turning their noses up at vaccines, refusing to wear masks and piling into parties, crowding into restaurants and sitting shoulder to shoulder at sporting events., \"As you have probably seen, the vaccination rates track very closely with the 2020 election results,\" said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College who specializes in political communication., And, with the exception of California, states where infections are increasing the most are all states where most voters supported Trump, including Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Missouri.,  , , \"What we are seeing playing out now with the surges and the checkerboard vaccination rates between the states has been going on from the very beginning,\" said Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown Law School., \"Whether it was ventilation or PPE or lockdowns, it\'s all been highly politicized. And after two years, I don\'t see that changing.\", The Biden administration is reaching out to the vaccine-resistant states, and encouraging Republican elected officials to speak in favor of vaccines, with mixed results. The federal government is also spending money on local pandemic communications and vaccination campaigns that make use of trusted local leaders in churches and community groups., And it\'s letting the scientists talk -- but mostly from the White House platform. This gives a national boost to what the CDC director or Surgeon General is saying, but it can also taint how their advice is viewed.,  , , \"Under Trump there was a widespread sense -- somewhat justified -- that he was forcing the CDC and FDA to do his bidding. Under Biden there is a widespread sense -- also somewhat justified -- that he doesn\'t have to force them; they want to do his bidding,\" said risk communications expert Peter Sandman., Biden goes to great lengths to deny this., \"I do not tell any scientists what they should do. I do not interfere,\" Biden said during a CNN town hall last week., And there doesn\'t seem to be much White House interference in the wording of CDC guidance, for example -- in sharp contrast to what happened under the Trump administration. But that\'s a low bar to beat., Following the science - but does science follow policy?, , \"It is indisputably true that President Biden listens to his agency heads and other expert advisers more than President Trump did. But it also seems to be true that the agencies are marching to the presidential drumbeat voluntarily under Biden at least as much as they marched to Trump\'s drumbeat because they had no choice,\" Sandman said., \"And like Trump, Biden prefers making pandemic-related announcements from the White House, with his agency heads and pandemic advisers in supporting roles, whether mute or voluble.\" , The effect is the people who are holding out against what the White House and federal agencies are asking them to do don\'t trust that the US Food and Drug Administration isn\'t colluding with the administration to rush out vaccines that don\'t work, aren\'t safe or that might even contain tracking chips. They don\'t trust that the CDC advice for unvaccinated people to mask up in public or in groups is really in their best interest., \"I would love to see a public health response that\'s separated as much as possible from the politics of the White House,\" said Nyhan., \"We need every American to get vaccinated, and if people see Tony Fauci and the head of the CDC as allies of the Biden administration, that could be counterproductive for precisely the people who so far haven\'t gotten vaccinated.\", A polarizing figure, And while many of the mistrustful Americans might be wary of federal agencies anyway, current efforts to keep the administration firmly in the forefront are backfiring., \"The president is an inherently polarizing figure in our politics,\" Nyhan said., \"They want to take credit for the vaccinations, but the best way to get people vaccinated is to get out of the way and let the public health community take the lead. And hopefully reduce the political temperature. I don\'t think it\'s too late,\" Nyhan added., \"I think of course they are trying to get credit,\" agreed Gostin. \"And the all-of-government response is important. But I think they could have taken credit for allowing CDC to take the lead on the science and the messaging.\", During past health emergencies -- whether it was the arrival of H1N1 influenza in 2009 or the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana in 2005 -- the CDC held its own briefings in Atlanta, led mostly by career public health service scientists and doctors who were independent of any administration., ,  , These briefings were lengthy and held several times a week during emergencies. They were meant to convey detailed medical and scientific information and to clear up questions and confusion. They led to well-informed reports in the media. They stopped under Trump when the pandemic started, and the Biden team has not restored them., \"The tradition has always been that Atlanta took the lead and the press briefings were coming out of Atlanta,\" Gostin said., \"I think that would be a wise thing to happen now. It would re-establish CDC\'s credibility. It might boost the public\'s trust in the agency. And it might take the politicization down a notch.\", Was Tuesday\'s CDC briefing on mask guidance a start? Only if the White House doesn\'t continue to bigfoot them., That should hold for other agencies, also, said Sandman.,  \"When the CDC has something new to say in the way of pandemic-related scientific information or science-based advice, it should say it in Atlanta. When the FDA has something new to say about vaccines or medicines to fight the pandemic, it should say it in Silver Spring,\" Sandman said. FDA is headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland., ,  , Instead, the FDA has been nearly silent about its decision making, with only occasional brief statements from acting director Dr. Janet Woodcock. Other FDA officials are reluctant to speak on the record because the White House has imposed a system of permissions that is ostensibly aimed at making sure the agencies\' messages are aligned. But the layers of red tape mean few people want to take the time to get clearance to speak. , CNN sought interviews with CDC, its parent Health and Human Services Department and the White House. None agreed to speak on the record -- perhaps another sign the Biden White House is concerned about keeping tight control over the message., It\'s important for Americans to see the White House paying attention and not spreading misinformation as Trump so often did. But there also needs to be space between the politicians and the scientists, said Nuzzo., \"I would love to see CDC be out front and center, even if it means having all the other entities stand behind the director,\" she said. \"I think it\'s really critical that we continue to assert the credibility of the CDC and the authority of the CDC as the top subject matter experts.\", ,  , The CDC has not fully explained the controversial surprise decision to say that vaccinated people were safe under almost all circumstances to go mask-free. It\'s also not reporting data about how many vaccinated people have breakthrough infections caused by the virus -- making it almost impossible to tell people the truth about how well the vaccines work., Walensky has promised the CDC will publish more -- and did publish a startling study Friday that showed 74% of people infected in a large outbreak in Massachusetts had been fully vaccinated. But the failure to release the information alongside or even ahead of new guidance can create the appearance of cherry-picking only the most favorable data., With vaccination rates lagging, case and hospitalizations headed upward again, and more people certain to die, the White House will have to act quickly to change these perceptions., \"We only have so many bites of the apple to get people to change their behavior,\" Nuzzo said., Nyhan summed it up. \"We live in an America where whatever the President touches becomes political, and everyone at every level of government needs to be thinking about how to get the tinge of politics off this vital lifesaving public health measure,\" he said.','https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/30/health/white-house-pandemic-divide-analysis/index.html',1,367),(272,'US vaccination rate hits the highest pace in weeks ','The rate of , The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Sunday that 816,203 additional doses were administered, the fifth straight day the agency recorded more than 700,000 shots in arms.

When breakthrough infections do happen in vaccinated people, they usually lead to mild or no symptoms at all., But vaccinated people who get breakthrough infections might be able to spread Covid-19 as easily as unvaccinated people, according to the CDC., \"High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus,\" CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Friday., That finding \"was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC\'s updated mask recommendation,\" Walensky said., But Collins said it\'s critical to emphasize how much more danger unvaccinated people are in, compared to vaccinated people.

Moderna has also filed for its vaccine to be licensed for younger teens and children in the U.S., Many public health officials say rich countries should donate their vaccines once their adult populations are covered, pointing out that millions of people in developing countries at high risk of the disease, including health workers and the elderly, have yet to receive a single shot., , In June, WHO\'s vaccines director Dr. Kate O\'Brien said that vaccinating children against COVID-19 is \"not a high priority\" given the extremely limited vaccine supplies globally.

Medications for cholesterol and high blood pressure help stabilize underlying diseases, and likely boost patients\' odds of recovering from COVID-19 disease, study authors said., , , Patients were 66 years old on average, and most patients (71%) had high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, or both. Over 80% of all patients taking statins were also taking at least one drug to treat high blood pressure, and patients taking either class of medication or both were typically older, female and had a number of health issues., Results indicated patients taking a statin alone saw a 46% lower odds of death, and about 25% lower risk of developing severe COVID, versus patients on neither class of medication. Patients taking both a statin and anti-hypertensive dropped risk of death by 40%., , \"As with any observational study, we cannot say for certain that the associations we describe between statin use and reduced severity of COVID-19 infection are definitely due to the statins themselves; however, we can now say with very strong evidence that they may play a role in substantially lowering a patient’s risk of death from COVID-19,\" Daniels said. \"We hope that our research findings are an incentive for patients to continue with their medication.\", Use of an anti-hypertensive drug alone was linked to a \"smaller albeit still substantial 27% lower odds [of death],\" the team found.

All three vaccines are good. JandJ might be even better if a second shot were added.\" , In a statement provided to Fox News, Johnson and Johnson cited previous studies which showed that a single-shot of its COVID-19 vaccine was 85% vaccine \"at protecting against severe disease and provided complete protection against hospitalization and death.\" , , The company said Landau’s study did not speak to the full nature of immune protection.

The decrease for both Black Americans and Hispanic Americans was even worse: three years., The drop spelled out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is due mainly to the COVID-19 pandemic, which health officials said is responsible for close to 74% of the overall life expectancy decline. More than 3.3 million Americans died last year, far more than any other year in U.S. history, with COVID-19 accounting for about 11% of those deaths., Black life expectancy has not fallen so much in one year since the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression. Health officials have not tracked Hispanic life expectancy for nearly as long, but the 2020 decline was the largest recorded one-year drop., , , The abrupt fall is \"basically catastrophic,\" said Mark Hayward, a University of Texas sociology professor who studies changes in U.S. mortality., Killers other than COVID-19 played a role. Drug overdoses pushed life expectancy down, particularly for whites. And rising homicides were a small but significant reason for the decline for Black Americans, said Elizabeth Arias, the report\'s lead author., Other problems affected Black and Hispanic people, including lack of access to quality health care, more crowded living conditions, and a greater share of the population in lower-paying jobs that required them to keep working when the pandemic was at its worst, experts said., Life expectancy is an estimate of the average number of years a baby born in a given year might expect to live. It’s an important statistical snapshot of a country’s health that can be influenced both by sustained trends such as obesity as well as more temporary threats like pandemics or war that might not endanger those newborns in their lifetimes., For decades, U.S. life expectancy was on the upswing. But that trend stalled in 2015, for several years, before hitting 78 years, 10 months in 2019. Last year, the CDC said, it dropped to about 77 years, 4 months., Other findings in the new CDC report:, —Hispanic Americans have a longer life expectancy than white or Black Americans but had the largest decline in 2020. The three-year drop was the largest since the CDC started tracking Hispanic life expectancy 15 years ago., —Black life expectancy dropped nearly three years, to 71 years, 10 months. It has not been that low since 2000., —White life expectancy fell by roughly 14 months to about 77 years, 7 months. That was the lowest life expectancy for that population since 2002., —COVID-19\'s role varied by race and ethnicity. The coronavirus was responsible for 90% of the decline in life expectancy among Hispanics, 68% among white people, and 59% among Black Americans., —Life expectancy fell nearly two years for men, but about one year for women, widening a longstanding gap. The CDC estimated life expectancy of 74 years, 6 months for boys vs. 80 years, 2 months for girls., , More than 80% of last year\'s COVID deaths were people 65 and older, CDC data shows. That actually diminished the pandemic\'s toll on life expectancy at birth, which is swayed more by deaths of younger adults and children than those among seniors., That\'s why last year\'s decline was just half as much as the three-year drop between 1942 and 1943 when young soldiers were dying in World War II. And it was just a fraction of the drop between 1917 and 1918 when World War I and a Spanish flu pandemic devastated younger generations., Life expectancy bounced back after those drops, and experts believe it will this time, too. But some said it could take years., Too many people have already died from COVID-19 this year, while variants of the coronavirus are spreading among unvaccinated Americans — many of them younger adults, some experts said., , \"We can\'t. In 2021, we can\'t get back to pre-pandemic\" life expectancy, said Noreen Goldman, a Princeton University researcher.','https://www.foxnews.com/health/us-life-expectancy-2020-saw-biggest-drop-wwii',2,396),(297,'‘No evidence’ of COVID-19 spread on school buses: study','A small study out of Virginia found school buses didn’t contribute to spread of COVID-19 between students or adults when physical distancing, universal masking and simple ventilation practices were in place. The study made no mention of viral variants, and the end of the study period coincided with initial cases of the highly transmissible Delta variant now linked to rising infections nationwide., Before the pandemic, some 26 million kids used 480,000 buses daily, according to study authors, two of whom also serve on the Virginia American Academy of Pediatrics school re-opening task force., Findings published in the Journal of School Health on July 20 analyzed COVID-19 transmission among 15 private school buses serving 462 students at an independent school grades 1-12 in Virginia. A robust screening program tested students on a biweekly, and later, weekly basis over a seven month period. Results indicated 39 people took the bus while infectious with COVID-19, leading to the quarantine of 52 students, however, \"universal testing and contact tracing revealed no transmission linked to bus transportation,\" the study reads., , About half of the students were in grades 1-6, 164 in grades 7-9 and 63 in grades 10-12. Students didn\'t undergo symptom or temperature checks or given hand sanitizer when boarding the bus, but the school system emailed a checklist home each night to families to encourage self-reporting of symptoms. Everyone was instructed to wear a mask while on the bus., Most of the buses were full, with students in nearly every seat and each route was at least 30 minutes long. Kids who tested positive, and took the bus, were sent home to self-isolate. The 52 students placed under quarantine due to potential exposure never developed symptoms and tested negative, according to the study., , A bus driver and an aide also tested positive, but contact tracing suggested the infections cropped up outside of work, and these infections didn’t result in any additional cases among students., \"There was no student-to-student transmissions, no adult-to-student transmissions, and no student-to-adult transmissions,\" study authors wrote, later adding, \"there was no evidence of COVID-19 transmission during bus transport, even at distances of 2.5 ft, with two-thirds of bus routes at full student capacity, and during the highest community incidence rates of COVID-19 which were 53.2 to 525.7 per 100,000 population for the study period.\", , Given the findings, researchers suggested 6 feet of distance may not be necessary to cut COVID-19 spread on buses. The latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises universal masking on buses regardless of the masking policy at school and boosting air circulation by opening windows. Kids under 12 are not yet eligible for COVID-19 vaccination, however Pfizer expects to request emergency approval for use of its vaccine in kids aged 5 to 11 by September or October., The study had its limitations, and authors specifically acknowledged that most public school systems grappling with widespread screening may not be able to identify infections quickly to quarantine students and reduce the amount of potential exposure.','https://www.foxnews.com/health/school-buses-covid-19-spread-study',2,398),(298,'Florida town hit by ‘triple threat’ of respiratory illnesses','Tampa Bay, Florida, is battling a unique combination of three separate respiratory illnesses, causing mass hospitalizations.

Doctors say that the symptoms usually include a short-lived but intense cough that can sometimes be fatal. Experts said this year\'s bloom is the worst the area has seen since 1971., , In addition to complications from red tide exposure, COVID-19 hospitalizations have tripled in the area, including among children. FOX 13 reported COVID-19 cases have increased by 87% in kids under 12, and 84% in children 12-17. Most infections are believed to be the delta variant. , COVID-19 and bronchitis can be difficult to tell apart from one another, Tampa Bay Area doctor John Greene told WFLA, but the telltale sign of COVID is the loss of taste and smell. , To make matters worse, doctors say that since most respiratory illnesses occur in winter, hospitals are unprepared to take on the three illnesses in the middle of summer. , , \"Hospitals have to be constantly on the alert to handle these large influxes.

The application approval could pave the way for the official approval of the other two vaccines, Moderna, which filed its application last month, and Johnson and Johnson., , More than 182.7 million people in the U.S. (more than half of the total population) have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), since the FDA granted emergency use authorization in December. And the urgency to get more Americans vaccinated comes as the delta variant of coronavirus cases continues to rise across the country. , Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson all received their EUA, which mandated that the companies follow a set of guidelines calling for safety data from clinical trials and information on its quality and consistency, according to ScienceMag.org., , Pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech and Moderna already submitted applications for full approval for their vaccines to the FDA on May 7 and June 1 to begin regulatory review. JandJ is expected to also file, however, the company had a few setbacks after the FDA announced a warning earlier this month of a possible link to Guillain-Barré, a rare autoimmune nerve disorder. The agency revised the vaccine\'s fact sheets to show an increased risk of the disorder following inoculation. , The difference between an EUA and full FDA approval involves further review of data over a longer time period, Science Mag reported., After applications are filed, FDA then reviews them to ensure completion for the first 60 days and further analyzes data related to safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality before issuing full approval, according to Science Mag., , Full FDA approval will allow vaccines to be used and marketed directly to consumers in the post-pandemic. The FDA\'s approval will likely promote more unvaccinated Americans to get their shots. Around a third of unvaccinated adults said they would be more likely to get vaccinated if one of the COVID-19 vaccines earned full FDA approval, according to a June survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF)., Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at the University of California, San Diego, told Science Mag Wednesday that full, FDA approval \"could help win over skeptics.\" , \"It means something to people for it to be approved,\" Gandhi told the outlet. \"It just seems like the simplest, easiest thing we could be doing right now.\", ','https://www.foxnews.com/health/full-fda-approval-for-covid-19-vaccines-could-ease-vaccine-hesitancy-expert',2,401),(300,'NJ hospital system threatening to fire unvaccinated employees faces backlash','Unvaccinated healthcare workers are sparking outrage after receiving an ultimatum from their employer.

Amanda Heim is a licensed practical nurse for a Hackensack Meridian hospital and one of the employees facing termination for her decision to not be vaccinated, she told Fox News. , \"I feel awful,\" she said. \"I feel like I have to choose between my values and a career, it\'s terrifying.\", Heim is one of the many Americans who don\'t trust the available COVID-19 vaccines despite assurances from federal health officials that they\'re safe and effective., \"I don\'t want to be vaccinated right now because I personally feel it is too soon,\" she said. \"We don\'t know what any long-term side effects may be.\", (), Heim said she was infected with the virus while she was eight months pregnant., \"I had COVID prior and at that time, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] said COVID posed no great risk to pregnant women,\' she said. \"Well, I spent a week-and-a-half quarantined in my bedroom. It finally got so bad that I had to go to the hospital, and I had an immediate emergency C-section. My baby was taken from me immediately.\", , Heim said it took three days before she could see her baby boy., \"So my trust in them is lacking,\" she said. , (), Dr. Nicole Saphier is a board-certified radiologist. She told Fox News that she believes healthcare workers with antibodies from a prior COVID-19 infection should be exempt from two-dose vaccination \"as ample data show the immunity from infection is robust at preventing future severe illness and decreasing viral transmission.\", \"Data also show while natural immunity is robust, a single dose increases the existing immunity even more,\" she added., , Saphier noted that vaccine requirements are common in the healthcare profession, but COVID-19 is different because the vaccines have been released under an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA rather than the agency\'s usual drug approval processes., \"In my opinion, mandates should not occur until full FDA approval has been granted while still allowing legitimate medical exemptions,\" Saphier said., Adm. Brett Giroir, a former White House COVID-19 task force member during the Trump administration, shared a similar stance., \"On a fully approved vaccine, it is pretty standard protocol that you can require vaccines for the purpose of employment; I do support that,\" he said. \"If I was running a healthcare system I would work very hard to try and work with people until it was finally approved, and then so be it. Personally, I would have a little flexibility as long as it was authorized and not firmly approved.\", Employes should offer an alternative, such as testing every day to make sure no staffers pass anything to patients, Giroir said., , \"I think that’s a reasonable alternative,\" he said. \"Once the vaccines get approved, I’m not saying I would mandate it as an employer, but I do support hospitals\' infection control standards.\", However, the new delta variant is much more contagious than previous variants and now accounts for the majority of new COVID cases, Giroir noted., \"I would urge and encourage that vaccination is the best way to stay safe, and it’s even more important now with this delta variant,\" he said., Hackensack Meridian\'s letter to employees does note that \"limited exemptions may be granted to the extent required by law,\" but doesn\'t specify what specifically would qualify an employee for an exemption., While people question the legality of employers mandating vaccines, congressional law expert Jonathan Turley told Fox News that private companies have a fair degree of flexibility for requiring public health protections and procedures. , \"The CDC has strongly recommended vaccines for healthcare workers so [healthcare employers] have a reasonable basis to require the vaccinations,\" Turley said. , , When pressed about unvaccinated individuals having any other options, Turley said it is possible to challenge the requirements in some states that have laws barring mandatory vaccinations by private employers, or if a court considered religious objections., The action by Hackensack Meridian Health has many questioning what will happen once, and if, the vaccine receives full FDA approval.

The government has since added more hospital beds and converted more wards for COVID-19 patients., Lam, 38, recalled once during his three weeks in the hospital hearing a machine beeping continuously for two hours before a nurse came to turn it off; he later learned the patient had died., , A variety of factors have contributed to the recent surge in the region, including people growing weary of the pandemic and letting precautions slip, low vaccination rates and the emergence of the delta variant of the virus, which was first detected in India, said Abhishek Rimal, the Asia-Pacific emergency health coordinator for the Red Cross, who is based in Malaysia., \"With the measures that countries are taking, if people follow the basics of washing the hands, wearing the masks, keeping distance and getting vaccinated, we will be seeing a decline in cases in the next couple of weeks from now,\" he said., So far, however, Malaysia’s national lockdown measures have not brought down the daily rate of infections. The country of some 32 million saw daily cases rise above 10,000 on July 13 for the first time and they have stayed there since., The vaccination rate remains low but has been picking up, with nearly 15% of the population now fully inoculated and the government hoping to have a majority vaccinated by year\'s end., Doctors and nurses have been working tirelessly to try to keep up, and Lam was one of the fortunate ones., After his condition initially deteriorated, he was put on a ventilator in an ICU unit filled to capacity and slowly recovered.

Cambodia and Thailand have also seen strong increases in both coronavirus cases and deaths, but have thus far held the seven-day rate per million people to a lower 1.55 and 1.38, respectively., Individual countries elsewhere have higher rates, but the increases are particularly alarming for a region that widely kept numbers low early in the pandemic., , Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous nation with some 270 million people, reported 1,449 deaths on Thursday, its deadliest day since the start of the pandemic., Daily cases through about mid-June had been about 8,000, but then began to spike and peaked last week with more than 50,000 new infections each day. Because Indonesia’s testing rate is low, the actual number of new cases is thought to be much higher., As hospitals there began to run out of oxygen, the government stepped in and ordered manufacturers to shift most production from industrial purposes and dedicate 90% to medical oxygen, up from 25%., Before the current crisis, the country needed 400 tons of oxygen for medical use per day; with the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases, daily use has increased fivefold to more than 2,000 tons, according to Deputy Health Minister Dante Saksono., Though the production of oxygen is now sufficient, Lia Partakusuma, secretary general of Indonesia’s Hospital Association, said there were problems with distribution so some hospitals are still facing shortages., In Indonesia, about 14% of of the population has had at least one vaccine dose, primarily China’s Sinovac., There are growing concerns that Sinovac is less effective against the delta variant, however, and both Indonesia and Thailand are planning booster shots of other vaccines for their Sinovac-immunized health workers., In Myanmar, the pandemic had taken backseat to the military\'s power seizure in February, which set off a wave of protests and violent political conflict that devastated the public health system., , Only in recent weeks, as testing and reporting of COVID-19 cases has started recovering, has it become clear that a new wave of the virus beginning in mid-May is pushing cases and deaths rapidly higher., Since the start of July its death rate has been climbing almost straight up, and both cases and fatalities are widely believed to be seriously underreported., On Tuesday, the government reported 5,860 new cases and 286 new deaths. There are no solid figures on vaccinations, but from the number of doses that have been available, it\'s thought that about 3% of the population could have received two shots., Officials this week pushed back at social media postings that cemeteries in Yangon were overwhelmed and could not keep up with the number of dead, inadvertently confirming claims that hospitals were swamped and many people were dying at home., , Cho Tun Aung, head of the department that oversees the cemeteries told military-run Myawaddy TV news on Monday that 350 staff members had been working three shifts since July 8 to ensure proper cremations and burials of people at Yangon’s seven major cemeteries., He said workers had cremated and buried more than 1,200 people on Sunday alone, including 1,065 who had died at home of COVID-19 and 169 who had died in hospitals., \"We are working in three shifts day and night to inter the dead,\" he said. \"It is clear that there is no problem like the posts on Facebook.\"','https://www.foxnews.com/health/death-rates-southeast-asia-covid-19-wave',2,404),(302,'Massachusetts town COVID-19 outbreak infects over 250','A coronavirus outbreak at a northern Massachusetts seaside town has swelled to over 250 infected following a July 4 holiday surge., Local health officials noted 256 confirmed cases linked to a cluster in Provincetown, with 190 infections among state residents, 109 of which involve people in the surrounding Barnstable County, with the remainder of cases among people outside of the state, according to a statement posted Wednesday.

It is most deadly when it enters the bloodstream, heart or brain. Outbreaks in health care facilities have been spurred when the fungus spread through patient contact or on contaminated surfaces., Health officials have sounded alarms for years about the superbug after seeing infections in which commonly used drugs had little effect. In 2019, doctors diagnosed three cases in New York that were also resistant to a class of drugs, called echinocandins, that were considered a last line of defense., (), In those cases, there was no evidence the infections had spread from patient to patient — scientists concluded the resistance to the drugs formed during treatment., The new cases did spread, the CDC concluded., In Washington, D.C., a cluster of 101 C. auris cases at a nursing home dedicated to very sick patients included three that were resistant to all three kinds of antifungal medications. A cluster of 22 in two Dallas-area hospitals included two with that level of resistance. The facilities weren’t identified., , Those cases were seen from January to April.

The study period began on May 15, 2020, and ended on October 20, 2020.,  , (), Exposure to wildfire PM2.5 accounted for an additional 178 positive COVID-19 cases at Renown alone between 16 Aug and 10 Oct 2020, or an increase of 17.7% [in the number of cases], authors wrote in part. During the study, over 35,000 people were tested at Renown, with 8% of tests returning positive. Most of the patients were over age 30, but the fastest increases in coronavirus-positive patients occurred among younger adults aged 18 to 29.  , Air quality was affected by wildfire smoke for 59 days during our study period, with 50 of those days occurring between 16 Aug and 10 Oct 2020, the study reads, later adding, We found a large increase in the SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rate at Renown during periods of elevated PM2.5 from wildfires. These results, although based on observational data with their inherent limitations, lend credence to earlier predictions that wildfire smoke would exacerbate the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also bolster arguments that PM2.5 from other sources, such as vehicle traffic or industry, increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2., , While the number of virus-related deaths was beyond the scope of the study, researchers said it was reasonable to assume that the excess cases due to wildfire PM2.5 resulted in excess mortality., The study had its limitations, including potential confounding factors in other harmful compounds in wildfire smoke (like carbon monoxide, ozone and nitrogen oxides), and researchers couldn’t account for differences in exposure on an individual basis owing to jobs or income., Our findings should help shape regional policies that seek to manage the combined threats of wildfires and the pandemic, authors concluded. These policies might include lowering the recommended healthy limit for PM2.5 in cities with a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, establishing ‘clean air’ shelters that maintain social distancing, and allocating sufficient quantities of appropriate respirators to areas at high risk for wildfires.','https://www.foxnews.com/health/wildfire-smoke-exposure-covid-19-case-increase-study',2,428),(324,'Moderna seeks to expand COVID-19 vaccine trial for kids','Moderna intends to expand a COVID-19 vaccine trial among kids under 12 to better monitor for potential rare side effects, a spokesperson confirmed to Fox News., \"It is our intent to expand the trial and we are actively discussing a proposal with the FDA,\" a Moderna spokesperson wrote to Fox News in an email. \"The objective is to enroll a larger safety database which increases the likelihood of detecting rarer events.\", \"At this point we expect to have a package that supports authorization in winter 2021/early 2022, should the FDA choose to use the authorization avenue,\" the statement continues in part., , The news comes after The New York Times reported earlier Monday that, at the \"urging\" of the FDA, Pfizer and Moderna were broadening the \"size and scope\" of their respective trials in kids aged 5-11 in a \"precautionary measure\" to spot rare adverse events post-vaccination, including heart inflammation.

But the findings do hint at something scientists already suspected: Some symptoms of long COVID emerge due to peripheral nerve damage, she said., COVID-19 long-haulers experience a wide range of symptoms, and a large proportion report neurological problems, including headache, numbness in the body, loss of smell and \"brain fog,\" or trouble thinking and concentrating, Live Science previously reported. This constellation of symptoms hints that long COVID may partly arise from damage to nerve cells in the body, said senior author Dr. Rayaz Malik, a professor of medicine and consultant physician at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar in Doha., , Specifically, preliminary evidence suggests that long COVID may involve damage to small nerve fibers — thin wires that branch off of specific nerve cells in the body and relay sensory information about pain, temperature and itchiness, among other sensations to the central nervous system. Small-fiber nerve cells also help control involuntary bodily functions, such as heart rate and bowel movements; therefore, damage to these cells can cause a wide array of symptoms. , Malik and his colleagues study small-fiber nerve loss in people with diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis; they noticed that people with long COVID appear to share similar symptoms with these patients, so they decided to investigate the potential link. , , Using a technique called corneal confocal microscopy (CCM), the team took snapshots of nerve cells in the cornea, the transparent layer of the eye that covers the pupil and iris. The team used the non-invasive procedure to count the total number of small-fiber nerve cells in the cornea, while also assessing the length and degree of branching of those fibers. In their work with other conditions, the team has found that, when you find damage in the small-fiber nerves of the cornea, that often indicates that there\'s similar damage elsewhere in the body. \"This is like a very good barometer, almost, of nerve damage elsewhere,\" Malik explained.  , According to the new study, published Monday (July 26) in the British Journal of Ophthalmology, people who develop neurological symptoms after a COVID-19 infection show significant small-fiber nerve loss in the cornea, compared with COVID-19 survivors without lingering neurological symptoms. What\'s more, the degree of nerve-fiber damage correlated with the participants\' symptom severity, meaning greater nerve damage was linked to more pronounced symptoms., 11 (SOMETIMES) DEADLY DISEASES THAT HOPPED ACROSS SPECIES, The small study included 40 people who had recovered from COVID-19 between one and six months prior to their assessment; out of the full group, 29 people had recovered from COVID-19 at least three months prior. In addition to getting the corneal scan, each participant completed a survey that included questions about any neurological symptoms of long COVID. , They also filled out questionnaires about neuropathic pain, which can include numbing, prickling and burning sensations in the body, as well as muscle weakness, according to UC Davis Health. Another questionnaire helped the researchers to pinpoint the location and severity of the participants\' muscle pain; it also helped flag additional symptoms like fatigue and bowel issues, the authors noted., , Of the 40 participants, 22 showed lingering neurological symptoms — including headache, dizziness and numbness — four weeks after recovering from their initial COVID-19 infections. And 13 out of the 29 who had been recovered for at least three months reported having neurological symptoms at week 12 post-infection. \"It\'s very clear, if you look at the graphs ... people who\'ve got the neurological symptoms definitely have a reduction\" in small-fiber nerves, while the other participants don\'t, Malik said., The study authors also assessed 30 healthy individuals with no history of COVID-19 infection for comparison. They found that, compared with these 30 control participants, all the COVID-19 survivors harbored a large number of immune cells on their corneas; more specifically, immune cells called dendritic cells that help inform the immune system of foreign invaders appeared in unusually high quantities., , The people with lingering neurological symptoms showed a roughly fivefold increase in these dendritic cells, compared with the healthy controls; those without neurological symptoms showed about a twofold increase. , \"So there\'s clearly something, there\'s an immune process that is still ongoing,\" even after the initial COVID-19 infection clears, Malik said. \"So maybe there is an immune trigger that is switched on and it takes time for it to kind of settle down,\" he said. And in the meantime, this runaway immune response damages nerve cells., , The new study cannot prove that an immune response caused the observed nerve damage. However, the idea does align with existing evidence that most neurological damage from COVID-19 is caused by inflammation, not by the virus infecting nerve cells directly, according to a 2020 commentary in the journal Pain., \"It\'s not the infection, per se, it\'s the immune response it provokes,\" said Dr. Anne Louise Oaklander, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and assistant in pathology at the Massachusetts General Hospital, who was not involved in the new study. \"Infection revs up your immune cells to start firing, to fight the enemy, and there\'s going to be collateral damage,\" she said. In this case, small-fiber nerve cells may fall victim to friendly fire. , , Oaklander added that she was \"excited\" about the new study, as it provides evidence of small-fiber nerve damage in long COVID patients. The data are helpful to biomedical researchers, like Oaklander, who are trying to understand the causes of long COVID and how to treat the syndrome. However, for now, she said the research doesn\'t necessarily provide any solutions for patients. , In their paper, Malik and his colleagues suggest that corneal confocal microscopy could be used as a diagnostic tool to help identify people with long COVID — particularly those with neurological symptoms. However, currently, the technique is primarily used for research and is not widely available in clinical settings, Oaklander said. , The gold standard for assessing small-fiber nerve damage involves taking a small skin biopsy from a patient\'s leg and measuring the nerve endings within, she said. Doctors can screen for symptoms of nerve damage with written surveys and neurological exams, but they currently require a skin biopsy to confirm their diagnoses. For this reason, it would be helpful if future studies of long COVID patients included these skin biopsies, along with the standard questionnaires used to screen for small-fiber sensory neuropathies, Oaklander suggested. (\"Neuropathy\" refers to damage to the nerves that run through the body outside the brain and spinal cord.) , For now, Malik said his group plans to follow up with their initial group of 40 participants, to see how their corneal nerves and long COVID symptoms change through time. In addition, they plan to replicate their study in larger groups of patients to validate the results., , \"People might say, \'Well, 40 patients isn\'t enough.\' We agree; you need larger studies,\" Malik said. Assuming the results can be confirmed in larger cohorts, eventually, this line of research may provide helpful hints as to how doctors can treat long COVID, he added. Treatments for post-infectious neuropathies do exist, it\'s just a question of whether they\'d work for long COVID patients with post-infectious small-fiber neuropathy, and if so, how they can best be applied, Oaklander said.,  ','https://www.foxnews.com/health/nerve-damage-cornea-long-covid-study',2,430),(326,'K-12 schools should implement universal masking to protect younger kids, expert says','Amid rising COVID-19 cases largely due to the delta variant, K-12 schools should instate universal masking measures to safeguard younger kids who are not yet eligible for vaccination, an Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) expert said Tuesday., The advice, given by Dr. Tina Tan, member of the IDSA board of directors and professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine, goes a step further than guidance given by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which currently recommends masks for unvaccinated individuals. , The health agency does note that \"based on the needs of the community, school administrators may opt to make mask use universally required (i.e., regardless of vaccination status) in the school.\" It is expected to issue an update Tuesday that some vaccinated people should return to wearing masks indoors. , , However, several states have already moved to ban mask mandates in schools, prompting families with immunocompromised members to worry about safely returning to in-person learning this fall. , \"I think that in the K-12 space, I do think mask mandates or universal masking in school settings should be enforced,\" Tan said during a briefing Tuesday, adding that immunocompromised students attending schools without mandates should still choose to wear one. , Tan cited data indicating that only 30% of kids aged 12-17 have received a COVID-19 vaccine, leaving a high number of students vulnerable to potential infection, especially as the delta variant surges in areas with low vaccination rates. She noted that rates of COVID-19 infection among kids, which currently account for about 14.2% of all cases in the U.S., have risen over the last month due to the variant. , , \"In order to protect these children who are too young to be vaccinated, efforts should be made to vaccinate all eligible people around these children,\" Tan stated, later noting that many teachers and staff in schools have not yet received a vaccine, prompting the need for more protective measures to safely return to in-person learning. , Among those protective measures, she said, is universal masking regardless of vaccination status, as well as social distancing, good ventilation and cohorting. , \"In the K-12 space, because the number of individuals vaccinated is a minority, I really do think that in order to protect students who are going to be attending in-person school you really need to have mask mandates in place,\" she said. , When asked about the role of routine testing for K-12 institutions, she said that while funds were set aside to expand capabilities, it remains \"very, very difficult\" for several reasons, including that the money was used to improve other aspects of schools., , And as far as a return to extracurricular activities, Tan said it may be necessary to \"go back to what we were doing prior to the availability of vaccination,\" which includes weighing risk of infection during the activity. , Dr. Preeti Malani, an IDSA fellow and the chief health officer at University of Michigan, was also in the briefing and said that rather than focus on what can and can’t be done, schools should focus on how to safely resume extracurricular activities so that it’s \"not zero risk, but acceptable risk.\" ','https://www.foxnews.com/health/k-12-schools-should-implement-universal-masking-protect-younger-kids-expert',2,432),(327,'Parents split on COVID-19 vaccine for young kids, poll finds','Over half of parents surveyed in a national poll said it was unlikely their child would receive a COVID-19 vaccine should the shots see expanded authorization in younger age groups., Findings released Monday from the C.S.

So if you can get your hands on a KN95 or N95 mask, that’s going to afford you a lot more protection.\", Both masks are designed to filter 95% of particles entering the mask.

The agency recommends essential workers and workers who routinely wore respirators before the pandemic continue wearing N95 respirators, and that as they become available they can be worn in non-health care settings. , , The agency also warns that about 60% of KN95 masks in the U.S. are counterfeit, and do not meet National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) standards. , Gottlieb said that while there were shortages early in the pandemic, masks have become more widely available so he would encourage others to \"look at the quality of their mask.\" , Still, the FDA warns that the \"optimal way to prevent airborne transmission is to use a combination of interventions from across the hierarchy of controls, not just PPE alone.\" , , The CDC also has not issued guidance that indicates certain masks may offer better protection against the variant, and instead suggests choosing a mask with two or more layers of washable, breathable fabric that completely cover the nose and mouth.

Under those recommendations, Americans who were fully vaccinated did not have to cover their faces unless they were in large crowds. , A month later, the CDC eased its guidance further for the fully vaccinated, saying that mask-wearing was not absolutely necessary in crowds and in most indoor settings. , The guidance still recommended that masks be worn in crowded indoor settings, like buses, planes, and hospitals but it cleared the way for reopening workplaces and other venues. Additional guidance said fully vaccinated people did not have to wear masks at schools. , , These recommendations came as deaths and hospitalizations were on the decline. But then the delta variant hit. At the beginning of summer, a mutated more transmissible version of the coronavirus began spreading across the country, especially in areas with low vaccination rates. , (), Now, the CDC says the delta variant can spread even among those who have been vaccinated. It is recommending that, regardless of vaccination status, teachers, staff, students and visitors at schools wear masks while indoors. , The CDC’s latest guidance applies in parts of the country experiencing at least 50 new cases per 100,000 people in the week prior – guidance that applies to 60% of U.S. countries. As of Tuesday, the U.S. is averaging more than 57,000 cases a day and 24,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations. , The agency has not published the data on which it is relying, but CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said it was \"concerning enough that we feel like we have to act.\" , , Anticipating a pushback, Walensky acknowledged that many Americans are weary of the pandemic and do not want to return to prevention measures. But she said new scientific information forced the decision to change the guidance again., \"This is not something that I took lightly,\" she said., Unsurprisingly, the guidance has been polarizing. Some public health experts are broadly in favor of masks but felt the CDC did a disservice by not issuing a call for Americans to document their vaccination status, in turn giving free rein for the unvaccinated to do what they want. , \"It was completely foreseeable that when they (the CDC) made their announcement, masking would no longer be the norm, and that\'s exactly what\'s happened,\" Lawrence Gostin, a public health law professor at Georgetown University, said. , Meanwhile, Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., quipped that the CDC ought to change its name to the \"Center of Demented Confusion.\" , South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, said her office wouldn\'t be mandating any mask rules, and accused the CDC of being inconsistent. , \"The CDC shifts their position AGAIN,\" Noem wrote on Twitter. \"South Dakota\'s cases remain low. If you\'re worried about the virus, you\'re free to get vaccinated, wear a mask, or stay at home. But we won\'t be mandating anything. And the CDC\'s inconsistency doesn\'t help the American people.\" , , The office of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – a longtime critic of the CDC’s mask policies – derided the latest guidance as ineffective. , \"It isn’t based in science,\" DeSantis press secretary Christina Pusha told Fox News. \"There is no indication that areas with mask mandates have performed any better than areas without mask mandates.

He went further, suggesting CDC advise school districts to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for teachers., The highly transmissible delta variant is the predominant strain circulating in the U.S., with the variant detected in eight in 10 sequenced samples, Walensky noted on Tuesday. Englund, an infectious disease expert with the Cleveland Clinic, compared the rapid emergence and spread of the delta variant to a \"wildfire,\" adding that advising masks for fully vaccinated populations in areas with substantial to high viral spread and other protective measures is a sound move., \"I think we’re learning every single day something new about this virus and this is a virus that has proven to us that it can change rapidly,\" Englund told Fox News. \"We’ve seen from May until July, that the variant has gone from less than 1% up to 80% [in prevalence], so this can spread like a wildfire and we need to do everything that we can to stop it because if not, it will change again.\", Americans should be flexible in regards to changing guidance, she said, given the emergence of the delta variant, adding, \"Masking we know is extremely effective in decreasing the spread of coronavirus and that’s where we\'re going to need to be moving at this point.\", ?, Dr. Gerald E.

Gavi, an alliance that secures vaccines for low-income countries, received 49 million doses, and another 57 million doses went to other countries., Sub-licensees, including the Serum Institute of India, supplied millions more doses, pushing global deliveries to more than 700 million doses., , The vaccine was developed by Oxford University researchers, who licensed the technology to AstraZeneca in an effort to tap into the company’s global manufacturing and distribution capacity. AstraZeneca, in turn, authorizes other companies to produce the shots around the world.','https://www.foxnews.com/health/astrazeneca-seek-us-approval-covid-19-vaccine-second-half',2,451),(344,'What is a COVID-19 vaccine \'breakthrough\' case?','What is a COVID-19 vaccine \"breakthrough\" case?, It’s when a fully vaccinated person gets infected with the coronavirus., , In studies, the two-dose COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna were around 95% effective at preventing illness, while the one-shot Johnson and Johnson shot was 72% effective, though direct comparisons are difficult. So while the vaccines are very good at protecting us from the virus, it’s still possible to get infected with mild or no symptoms, or even to get very sick., If you do end up getting sick despite vaccination, experts say the shots help reduce the severity of the illness — the main reason to get vaccinated., , But the understanding of how vaccinated people who are infected might spread the virus to others is changing., Previously, health officials believed vaccinated people who get breakthrough infections were unlikely to spread the virus. But with the more contagious delta variant that is now dominant, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said new data shows people who get infected could carry enough virus in their noses and throats to spread it to others., The agency recently cited the data in updating its guidance to say vaccinated people should go back to wearing masks indoors in areas where the virus is surging., \"It is concerning enough that we feel like we have to act,\" said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky., , Still, health experts say the vaccines provide strong protection against serious illness.

It\'s the second time the FDA has extended the shelf life on the vaccines since June, when the agency said they could be used for up to 4 1/2 months. When first authorized in February, the FDA said the vaccines could be stored for three months at normal refrigeration levels., , Health authorities in many states had recently warned that they could be forced to throw out thousands of doses of the one-shot vaccine without an extension., The change gives health providers more time to use remaining shots sitting at pharmacies, hospitals and clinics. After plateauing earlier this summer, vaccination rates have begun climbing again as the contagious delta variant surges across many parts of the country., Vaccine expiration dates are based on information from drugmakers on how long the shots stay at the right strength. JandJ previously stated that it continues to conduct stability testing with the aim of further extending the shelf life of the shots., The FDA has been reviewing expiration dates on all three U.S.-authorized vaccines as companies have continued to test batches in the months since the shots first rolled out. Vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, authorized in December, have a six-month shelf life., JandJ’s vaccine was highly anticipated because of its one-and-done formulation and easy-to-ship refrigeration., But rival drugmakers Pfizer and Moderna, which started shipping shots months earlier, have already supplied more than enough doses to vaccinate all eligible Americans. More than 150 million Americans have been fully vaccinated with the companies’ two-dose shots. By comparison, just 13 million Americans have been vaccinated with the JandJ shot., , Use of JandJ’s vaccine has been hurt by several rare potential side effects. Earlier this month, U.S. health regulators added a new warning to the vaccine about links to a potentially dangerous neurological reaction called Guillain-Barré syndrome., That followed a pause in the use of the shot in April after it was linked to a rare blood clot disorder.

Dobbs pinned the rise in cases on low vaccination numbers combined with rapid spread of the delta variant and an increase in activity among residents. , \"We know that a majority of transmission is occurring among and from unvaccinated folks,\" he said, noting that about 95% of new cases are among this population. , , However, he noted that spillover from this transmission is impacting vaccinated individuals, sometimes with fatal implications. Dobbs said that about 20% of the state’s COVID-19 fatalities are occurring among fully vaccinated individuals, with the majority of these fatal breakthrough cases occurring in people over 65 with underlying medical issues or who are immunocompromised. , He also noted an uptick in hospitalizations of people under the age of 50. , \"Sadly, we are reporting the death of a teenager in the state of Mississippi, who died from COVID-19,\" he said. \"We now have four deaths in children in the state of Mississippi, two in the age range of 11 to 17, one between 6 and 10 and one between ages 1 and 5.\" , , He did not reveal where the deceased teen was from, nor an exact age, but said the underlying illness is \"a common medical issue, it’s nothing that people don’t live with every day in the state of Mississippi commonly.\" , \"This is a real tragedy and speaks to the importance of us preventing transmission,\" Dobbs said. \"Although severe outcomes in children are rare, when we have a whole lot of transmission we have a lot of cases we are unfortunately going to see this type of tragedy from time to time.\" , The state currently has about 34% of its population fully vaccinated, which is among the lowest percentage in the country. ','https://www.foxnews.com/health/mississippi-teen-died-covid-19-common-medical-issue',2,455),(347,'Texas pediatric hospitals report uptick in COVID-19 patients','Northern Texas hospitals are reporting an increase in pediatric COVID-19 patients as federal data indicates the state is battling a high level of viral transmission., As of July 28, Cook Children\'s had 14 COVID-19 patients, with a seven day positivity rate at 9%, hospital spokesperson Kim Brown told Fox News.

Yale University researchers, who published their findings in the journal Nature Behavior, also noted that paranoia was heightened in states with low adherence to mask mandates. , , Research involving the role uncertainty plays in the development of feelings of paranoia was already underway when the pandemic began, so the team built on their data in real-time. Using online surveys and card games in which rules could suddenly change, possibly prompting people to change choices regardless of prior outcomes, the team found increased levels of paranoia and choice volatility among the general population. , , Taking it a step further, they also investigated the effect of public health policy choices in states where masks were mandated versus recommended, according to a news release. Their findings suggested an uptick in paranoia and erratic choice behavior in areas with mandates. They also found an association between feelings of paranoia and greater acceptance of conspiracy theories regarding masks, vaccines and QAnon theories. , \"From a policy standpoint, it is clear that if a government sets rules, it is important that they are enforced and people are supported for complying,\" Phil Corlett, associated professor of psychology and senior author of the study, said in a news release. \"Otherwise they may feel betrayed and act erratically.\" , He added that the findings reflected \"essentially people got paranoid when there was a rule and people were not following it.\" , , The team noted that heightened paranoia following crises, whether terror attacks or pandemics or other events, has been documented before. ','https://www.foxnews.com/health/covid-19-mask-mandates-associated-increased-paranoia-study-suggests',2,457),(349,'Israel to offer Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine booster to adults over 60, report says','Israel will reportedly begin offering a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for people ages 60 and older, weeks after it opened up the availability of a third jab to at-risk populations.  The move, reported via Israeli TV and radio but not yet published on the Ministry of Health website, comes amid a rapid rise in the delta variant. , , Pfizer this week published data suggesting that a third dose of its vaccine would strongly boost protection against the delta variant. A preprint also suggested that efficacy dropped to about 84% about six months after the second dose. , Boosters remain a hotbed for debate in countries around the world, especially as health agencies investigate so-called breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals and reinstate mask mandates in a bid to stop the spread. , , Pfizer previously indicated that it would seek emergency use authorization from the FDA for a booster dose in August, a move which at first drew a sharp response from the agency and the CDC. Since then, Dr. Anthony Fauci has said a third shot might be necessary at least for some populations. , Israel had been considered a world leader in vaccination, with over 56% of its population fully inoculated, and had lifted almost all virus-related restrictions a few weeks ago.

The paper reported that the CDC document says health officials need to acknowledge the \"war has changed.\", The CDC did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News. The information in the document reportedly played a role in the new mask guidelines announced earlier this week. The Biden administration has been more assertive in recent days to compel Americans to sign up for a vaccine due to the emergence of variants., , Admiral Brett Giroir, the former assistant health secretary under President Trump, told Fox News’ \"America Reports\" on Thursday that the variant is so contagious that it is \"just a matter of time\" before everyone who is not vaccinated and hasn’t had COVID-19 comes down with the infection., \"If you have prior immunity you do have some protection, but more and more data are telling us that that protection is not so good against delta,\" he said. \"Remember, you can get the flu every year. It’s not because your immunity isn’t good. It’s because the flu changes and delta is really a new strain that is different than everything we’ve seen. So, I am really concerned that natural immunity, although real, is not going to be sufficient against Delta.\", Giroir’s comments seem to echo the CDC’s document.

What’s more, in a statement accompanying the report, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky reported \"similarly high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated people.\", \"High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus,\" Walensky said. \"This finding is concerning and was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC’s updated mask recommendation.

The U.S. has not authorized any of the COVID-19 vaccines for kids under 12, and only about 30% of adolescents ages 12-17 have received one. , Parents opposed to mandates cite the low death rate in kids, but one pediatrician warned that the data may not be telling the whole story. , , \"Although this number is relatively low, there are still a significant number of kids being hospitalized,\" Dr. Steven Abelowitz, MD, FAAP, regional director of Coastal Kids Pediatrics, told Fox News. \"And the amount of deaths in children is not insignificant.

This could be a result of vaccinated people increasing their social activities, several experts told Fox News. Still, among vaccinated individuals, severe illness remains rare due to vaccine efficacy. , A former CDC official noted that the virus’ behavior may not be well documented in children. , , \"Because we’re not testing children as much, we’re not sure that we have really good reliable data on how many deaths, hospitalizations, so forth are occurring in that group,\" Dr. Robert Amler, dean of School of Health Sciences and Practice at New York Medical College, and a former chief medical officer at the CDC Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, told Fox News. \"Remember, every child, every adult who gets infected with the virus gives the virus an opportunity to grow more and mutate again to other strains.

The parent has to be calm, manage their stress and their own worries about the transition., Virtual schooling likely shifted kids’ sleep schedules, and two weeks ahead of the new school year, parents should scale back children\'s schedules by about 15-20 minutes, said Dr. Mary Alvord, Ph.D., co-author and practicing psychologist in Maryland, who notes sleep is critical for regulating mood and behavior, learning and clear thinking., , Alvord said parents should then talk to children about the transition to ease into a new school, grade or building, and suggested taking the planned bus route or visiting the campus so the child has some exposure before the first day of school. If the child has a group of friends, it can make the first week easier, she added, suggesting parents arrange distanced hangouts to encourage friendships ahead of the school year., There’s been so much uncertainty and change, and uncertainty drives anxiety, Alvord continued, advising parents communicate that they have their child’s safety in mind, and should COVID-related guidance evolve, parents will communicate any changes to children., Experts note it’s important to discuss grief associated with the pandemic, whether it was the loss of a family member or missed educational and social opportunities, as the pandemic also disrupted the normal grieving process, with patients isolated in hospitals and funeral arrangements impacted by health and safety measures., Parents need to acknowledge the losses, Alvord said., The experts\' anecdotal evidence with pediatric patients suggests mixed attitudes regarding the return to in-person schooling; while some have anxiety, many kids are excited to see friends and return to some sense of normalcy. While a certain degree of anxiety is normal, parents should contact a primary care provider if they sense a child\'s sadness and anxiety exceeds expected behavior, and signs can include withdrawal from friends and family, constant crying and eating too much or too little. In these instances, don\'t hesitate to contact a provider or trusted support system for help, Lopez-Arvizu said., , Finally, validate children’s feelings and worries, and then work together to problem solve the issue, Alvord said, noting that parents can build resiliency in children by encouraging positive attitudes and focusing on what’s in control. , We are all resilient in so many ways, we can focus on the things we can control and can do something about, Alvord said. Our belief that we can handle things and problem solve and figure things out is really important, advising to tell kids, We’re not helpless, we can do something, we just have to be thoughtful about what we do.','https://www.foxnews.com/health/school-anxiety-prepping-kids-in-person-learning',2,476),(365,'Florida family sees 3 COVID-19 deaths in matter of days','A Florida woman is grieving the loss of her grandmother, mother, fiancé and future father-in-law who all died within days of each other after contracting COVID-19.

Some states have indicated they will probably heed the federal government\'s guidance and require masks. Others will leave the decision up to parents., , The controversy is unfolding at a time when many Americans are at their wits\' end with pandemic restrictions and others fear their children will be put at risk by those who don\'t take the virus seriously enough. In a handful of Republican-led states, lawmakers made it illegal for schools to require masks., In Connecticut, anti-mask rallies have happened outside Gov. Ned Lamont’s official residence in Hartford, and lawn signs and bumper stickers call on him to \"unmask our kids.\" The Democrat has said that he’s likely to follow the latest advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., The CDC on Tuesday recommended indoor masks for all teachers, staff, students and visitors at schools nationwide, regardless of vaccination status. The agency cited the risk of spread of the highly contagious delta variant, even among vaccinated people., , Alima Bryant, 33, a mother of four who organizes anti-mask parents in Branford, Connecticut, said she\'s not a conspiracy theorist, but she believes scientists have overstated the dangers of COVID-19, especially for children. She said she will take her children out of school rather than subject them to wearing masks, which she believes are more likely to make them ill than the virus., \"Especially with little kids, I can imagine how often they\'re touching dirty things, then touching the mask,\" she said. \"Also, in kindergarten, you have to learn social cues, and even with speech and everything, it\'s so important to not be wearing a mask.\", But parents such as Ryan Zuimmerman, of Lenexa, Kansas, fear that approach will prolong the pandemic., In Johnson County, Kansas, the state’s most populous county, five districts recommend but do not require masks. A sixth district has not yet decided., Zimmerman, speaking at a recent meeting of country commissioners, said that if masks are only recommended and not required, \"95% of kids won’t be wearing them.\", \"This isn’t about comfort or control or obedience or your rights.

You have already done damage to these kids having to wear masks,\" she said before putting her daughter up to the microphone, where the little girl complained that masks make it hard for her to breathe and give her headaches., But Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Delaware Division of Public Health, said there is no credible evidence masks are unsafe for children. She said the science is clear that face coverings have prevented the spread of COVID-19 in schools., \"If we want to have kids in school this fall, and as many kids as we possibly can get into school, masks are a key component,\" she said., Amid the debate, there is also a push to get more older kids vaccinated. President Joe Biden has asked schools to host vaccine clinics for those 12 and older, and states are also beginning to discuss whether to mandate that school employees either be vaccinated or undergo frequent testing for the coronavirus., , \"To me that seems very reasonable,\" said Dr. Joseph Kanter, the state health officer of the Louisiana Department of Health. \"You achieve the goal of providing a safe environment. You maintain some choice in there. And clearly most people are going to look at that and say it make sense for them to get vaccinated, given that context.\", The push to vaccinate children varies by country. Half of 12- to 17-year-olds in Estonia\'s second-largest city of Tartu have received their first vaccine shot, and local health officials are working to push the number to 70% before the school year begins. Countries such as Denmark and France also are actively encouraging vaccination of children, while others such Sweden and the United Kingdom have yet to begin mass vaccinations for those under 18., The Pfizer shot is currently the only U.S. vaccine authorized for children 12 years and up. Moderna expects the Food and Drug Administration to rule soon on its application for children in the same age group., Moderna said Monday that it expects to have enough data to apply for FDA authorization for younger children by late this year or early 2022. Pfizer has said it expects to apply in September for children ages 5 through 11., But some parents, such as Bryant, say they will not get their children vaccinated, even after the kids are eligible, until they know more about potential side effects. Bryant said she knows people who have had severe reactions and others who believe it has affected their menstrual cycles., Kanter urges families to vaccinate all eligible children. He said the argument that they rarely get severely ill from COVID-19 is becoming outdated., \"As an absolute number, we are seeing younger individuals and kids get sicker in higher numbers and get more severe numbers with delta than they have before,\" he said., Young people themselves have been wrestling with misinformation and vaccine hesitancy among parents and peers., Angelica Granados, 16, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, finally got permission from her mother to take a COVID-19 vaccine last month.

Walensky said, for each person infected with the delta variant, it\'s estimated they could infect about five other unvaccinated people, or more than twice as many as the original strain., Infections with the delta variant also result in higher viral loads, meaning those infected have a large burden of virus they can spread to others, she continued. Those higher viral loads are seen in similar levels across unvaccinated and among a small proportion of those vaccinated and infected, Walensky said., \"While we desperately want to be done with this pandemic,  COVID-19 is clearly not done with us, and so our battle must last a little longer,\" she said, emphasizing the power of vaccines in preventing poor outcomes, like hospitalization and death, urging people to wear masks in public indoor areas amid high and substantial viral spread and urged universal masking in schools this fall.','https://www.foxnews.com/health/increasing-vaccination-rates-southern-states-positive-trend-white-house',2,482),(370,'COVID-19 symptoms: What to look for, according to the CDC','With COVID-19 cases on the rise amid continued spread of the concerning delta variant, quick identification of symptoms, testing and isolation can limit further exposures and reduce transmission., , According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), symptoms of COVID-19 can range in severity and may include: , Symptoms typically appear about two to 14 days following initial exposure, and people exhibiting these symptoms should seek a COVID-19 test, the CDC advises.

He has barred local governments and school districts from imposing mandatory mask mandates and vaccine requirements., But throughout the state, hospitals are again seeing their COVID-19 wards filling after nearly emptying in June., Baptist Health in Miami has opened several new COVID-19 units at its hospitals to house its more than 220 infected patients, a 140% increase in two weeks, and is preparing to open another unit this week. Dr. Sergio Segarra, its medical director, said it was \"a big mistake\" for the state to drop mask mandates., \"We said the vaccinated could stop wearing their masks — and the unvaccinated stopped wearing their masks, too.\" Segarra said. \"People have been more lax and now is the time not to be lax.\", Segarra fears there won’t be enough nurses, respiratory therapists and other workers to staff the new units — a concern other hospital officials have also voiced., , Ed Jimenez, CEO of University of Florida Health Shands in Gainesville, said coronavirus patients are some of the most labor intensive, leaving doctors, nurses and others exhausted when their numbers increase. His emergency room staff is again wearing N-95 masks at all times and that protocol will likely soon expand to other departments. His hospital now has 146 patients with the virus, up from 14 a month ago and just short of its all-time high of 157 in January., Jimenez urged the unvaccinated to get their shots to help medical workers and to prevent the state\'s smaller hospitals from being overrun. He fears smaller institutions will soon be forced to send patients with broken bones and less serious illnesses to major regional hospitals, like his that are 50 or more miles away. Many of the small, rural counties outside Gainesville have vaccine rates of less than 40% and many are seeing some of the worst outbreaks on a per capita basis., \"If you live in that community and you need to go to the hospital, what is going to happen?\" he said., AdventHealth in central Florida said most COVID-19 patients will no longer be allowed to have visitors, with exceptions made for children, new mothers and the dying.

Across the country, pediatric hospitals are reporting increasing trends among younger children who are not yet eligible for vaccination. , Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, MD, vice provost for global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania and co-director of the health transformation institute added that the observed shift in age could be due to higher vaccination rates among older adults, particularly among those over 65., , \"When you have large numbers of people infected, even if the rate of hospitalizations and deaths are low, that number will go up,\" he said, adding that he doesn’t think the U.S. has \"a good handle yet on what case frequency is among young people.\"  ','https://www.foxnews.com/health/delta-covid-19-variant-dangerous-original-strain-expert',2,487),(375,'CDC data reflects spiking RSV cases into July','National reports of a common respiratory virus increased into July, according to laboratory data submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Cases dropped dramatically last year, with people staying home and social distancing, but began cropping up as pandemic restrictions eased., The health agency’s national surveillance system suggests PCR tests positive for the virus began to climb by June, with approximately 3% test positivity, before further increasing into mid-July with a test positivity over 13% by July 17. The latest figures may reflect an undercount due to lags in reporting., , Antigen detection for RSV suggests a greater uptick in about the same time period, with the test positivity increasing from about 10% in early April to over 35% by mid-July., Symptoms typically crop up in stages within 4-6 days following infection, and can include a runny nose, smaller appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing, the CDC states on its webpage. Younger infants may only show irritability, less activity and breathing issues., , Among U.S. kids under age 5, RSV typically leads to 2 million doctor-office visits each year, 58,000 hospitalizations and up to 500 deaths — higher than the estimated toll on kids from COVID-19. Among adults aged 65 and up, RSV can lead to pneumonia and causes almost 180,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths yearly. Cases in kids and adults usually occur in fall through early spring., In adults, symptoms are typically consistent with upper respiratory tract infections including rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, cough, headache, fatigue and fever. For severe cases, however, it can also cause more severe infections such as bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small airways in the lung, and pneumonia, an infection of the lungs. It is also the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1, according to the CDC. , Most infections resolve on their own and there is no specific treatment for RSV, though efforts to develop medicines are underway, per the CDC.

He was given prescriptions for two antibiotics and again released from the hospital., ,, The man came back the next day with more serious symptoms, including fever, dizziness, chills and \"swollen glands.\" He was admitted to the hospital and treated with antibiotics for suspected sepsis, potentially life-threatening body-wide inflammation that can result from an infection., He tested negative for COVID-19 twice, and a blood sample was sent to a commercial laboratory to help identify the cause of his infection. On June 30, 2020, the lab reported that the man tested positive for Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, a bacterium that can spread from animals to people and can cause fever, abdominal pain and, in some cases, a rash and blood infection. It\'s closely related to Yersinia pestis. The man started a two-week course of the antibiotic vancomycin and was allowed to leave the hospital on July 1, 2020., But the diagnosis of Y. pseudotuberculosis would turn out to be wrong. On July 10, 2020, the hospital sent a sample of the man\'s blood to Arizona State Public Health Laboratory, which identified Y. pestis in the sample. Health officials confirmed the diagnosis of plague on July 15, 2020, nearly a month after the man first experienced symptoms. , The man was diagnosed with septicemic plague, a type of plague that causes fever, chills, extreme weakness, abdominal pain and sometimes bleeding into the skin and other organs, according to the CDC. (People with septicemic plague have sepsis caused by Yersinia pestis.), ?, He was then prescribed the appropriate treatment, which in this case was a 10-day course of the antibiotic doxycycline. The delay in diagnosis could have threatened the man\'s chances of survival. \"This patient did not receive high-efficacy antibiotic treatment ... until approximately 30 days after symptom onset,\" the report said., The man\'s eventual recovery may have been due, in part, to his early treatment with antibiotics; although they were not the best antibiotics to treat plague, they do have some effectiveness against plague bacteria, the report said., Plague is perhaps best known for causing the Black Death in Europe in the 1300s. The infection still occurs today, but it is very rare, with about seven cases of plague occurring in the U.S. each year, on average, according to the CDC. The man\'s case was the first reported case of plague in Arizona since 2017, the authors said., Humans can catch the plague through fleabites or contact with the tissue or bodily fluids of an infected animal. The man reported handling a dead pack rat (a rodent belonging to genus Neotoma) while wearing gloves before he became ill., Early and prompt treatment with antibiotics is important to avoid serious complications, including death. Before the advent of antibiotics, the death rate from plague in the U.S. was about 66%, but today the rate is around 11%, according to the CDC., , In Arizona, hospitals and labs that identify any bacterium within the Yersinia genus are required to submit the samples to the state public health lab for further testing within one business day, the report said. But in this case, there was a 10-day delay in submitting the sample. The reason for the delay is unclear, but the laboratory staff underwent re-education about this requirement, the report said., \"Rapid reporting might have led to timelier diagnosis of his acute illness and initiation of a more effective antibiotic therapy closer to disease onset,\" the report concluded.,  ','https://www.foxnews.com/health/arizona-man-month-plague',2,508),(396,'Unvaccinated individuals twice as likely to face COVID-19 reinfection: CDC study','A new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study found that unvaccinated individuals who have had COVID-19 are twice as likely to face reinfection as individuals who have received the vaccine. , The study, published as part of the agency\'s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), examined hundreds of residents, finding that the unvaccinated individuals had 2.34 times greater odds of reinfection compared with fully vaccinated individuals. , The residents were aged 18 or older and had previous COVID-19 infections in 2020 and experienced a second infection between May and June 2021 – the time period that aligns with the emergence and spread of the delta variant. , (), \"If you have had COVID-19 before, please still get vaccinated,\" said Centers for Disease Control Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky in a statement released Friday. \"This study shows you are twice as likely to get infected again if you are unvaccinated.\", , \"Getting the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others around you, especially as the more contagious Delta variant spreads around the country,\" she added. , The delta variant has shown to be far more transmissible than other strains of COVID-19; Walensky noted in mid-July that the variant is \"spreading with incredible efficiency and now represents more than 83% of the virus circulating the United States.\" , , However, the CDC stressed that the COVID-19 vaccines remain safe and effective and are the best way to prevent infection. , MMWR also published a study that pointed to the success of the vaccines in preventing COVID-19 related hospitalizations among the highest-risk age groups. , , The second study indicated that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in adults aged 65-74 were 96% effective in preventing hospitalization – a figure that dropped only slightly to 91% in populations over 75 years in age. , The Janssen vaccine – produced by Johnson and Johnson – is 85% effective in both age groups. , , That effectiveness is still more than double the effectiveness of the average flu shot, which in 2019-2020 was 39% effective. ','https://www.foxnews.com/health/unvaccinated-individuals-twice-likely-covid-19-reinfection',2,509),(397,'‘Doomsday variant’ report guilty of fear mongering, experts say','Numerous infectious disease experts have criticized a report of a new, looming coronavirus variant far worse than delta or lambda, calling the report fear mongering, or stoking undue fear among the public by amplifying unlikely worst-case scenarios., Is there a Doomsday variant out there that shrugs off vaccines, spreads like wildfire and leaves more of its victims much sicker than anything we\'ve yet seen? reads a recent article published in Newsweek Magazine. The odds are not high that we will see such a triple threat, but experts can\'t rule it out., , Dr. Michael Osterholm, epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told Newsweek the next variant could be Delta on steroids, with the reporter writing the delta variant shattered optimism in de-escalating the pandemic with vaccine rollout., We have every reason for optimism, Dr. Tracy Beth Høeg, epidemiologist and associate researcher at University of California, Davis, told Fox News adding in part, this line ‘Delta has now shattered that optimism,’ is not appropriate. I would indeed consider this fear mongering., , As viruses evolve, they spin off variants, explains Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News medical contributor and professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center. Boosting the number of shots in arms helps prevent emerging variants by narrowing the opportunity for it to spread and mutate., Epidemiologists and infectious disease docs should continue to study variants, but it is not necessary (or healthy in my opinion) for the public to go around worrying about the variants getting increasingly worse, Høeg wrote, suggesting Americans hold journalists to higher standards., Numerous physicians reiterated to Fox News that the COVID-19 vaccines remain highly effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death despite the spread of concerning variants, including delta, as also noted in the report., According to Dr. Monica Gandhi, infectious diseases and HIV doctor at UCSF, we cannot eliminate COVID-19 due to its high transmissibility and our lacking native immunity, but we can control the virus, which may ultimately cause mild symptoms in a small fraction of vaccinated individuals, and outbreaks of severe disease among those who have yet to receive shots. She also emphasized the complexity in the immune system and noted that T cells form an in-breadth response across the spike protein and the variants cannot evade T cell immunity. T cells protect us against severe disease., Several experts told Fox News that, should the need arise, drugmakers behind mRNA vaccines, like Pfizer and Moderna, can tweak the shot to better protect against variants with a quick turn-around time. , , The reason that the delta variant is winning out is because of how transmissible [it is], Siegel said. It’s not like some deadly version of this is going to compete and beat out the delta variant; the only thing that could take over from the delta variant is one that’s more contagious...I don’t see this changing enough so it suddenly reinfects everybody that\'s already had it, and eludes the vaccine., Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases and chair of the department of medicine at Mount Sinai South Nassau, noted he has some of the same concerns outlined in the Newsweek report, however the question is the likelihood of those concerns becoming reality., Everything in that article is correct but it doesn\'t mean it is necessarily going to happen, these are possibilities, he said, later adding, We don\'t know what will be the next variant to come. We have an inkling of some of the strains spreading throughout the world but which one will come to the United States or which one will become predominant in different parts of the world, Lambda or some of the other ones, really is unknown., According to Newsweek, all told, the chances that a virus in the population will produce a much more dangerous variant in the course of a year would normally be extremely low. But when billions of people are infected with billions of copies of a virus, all bets are off., However, Høeg counters the claim, writing: Given what we have seen with the previous variants, I don\'t think there is any reason to believe future variants will be more likely to cause more severe disease., , Dr. Imran Sharief, a California-based pulmonary disease specialist, told Fox News that new variants are going to continue to emerge until we reach herd immunity and the virus loses its strength., Moving forward, Americans have to change their lifestyles and take preventive steps until we reach herd immunity, Sharief said, predicting the virus could lose its potency by at least 2024., Høeg, researcher at UC Davis, concluded in writing: It is a dangerous and destructive game for journalists to constantly be speculating about the worst possible scenarios (especially without solid evidence they are likely).','https://www.foxnews.com/health/doomsday-variant-fear-mongering',2,510),(398,'FDA nearing decision on COVID vaccine boosters for people with weakened immune systems','The Food and Drug Administration is nearing a decision on COVID-19 vaccine booster shots for people with weakened immune systems., The FDA has been closely monitoring data on studies about administering an extra dose for immunocompromised individuals, a spokesperson told Fox News.

A widely held belief is that it originated to prove to someone that a person was offering peace and not holding a hidden weapon. But hands can be germy — coated with fecal matter and E. coli., Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, cautioned last year, \"I don’t think we should ever shake hands ever again, to be honest with you.\", On the other side is Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University.

Older children were more likely to be involved in the initial case, and 27% of the 6,280 households reported a secondary infection involving another member. , Data revealed that children ages 0 to 3 years old, although less likely to bring the infection into the house, were more likely to spread the virus to another member than those ages 14 to 17 years old. Children ages 4 to 8 also had increased odds to spread the virus, as did those ages 9 to 13, but the greatest was among the younger population. , , \"Differential infectivity of pediatric age groups has implications for infection prevention controls within households and schools/childcare to minimize risk of household secondary transmission,\" the researchers who were supported by Public Health Ontario, wrote. \"Although children do not appear to transmit infection as frequently as adults, caregivers should be aware of the risk of transmission while care for sick children in the household setting.\" , Researchers noted that it’s \"challenging and often impossible\" to isolate from sick children, and as such caregivers should implement other infection control measures like wearing masks, washing hands and keeping them separate from siblings. , The researchers noted that the role of young children in the pandemic is not well known, as early on testing was reserved for health care workers and symptomatic patients. Interaction during lockdown was also limited to household members, meaning children were kept out of daycares and school settings. The study also noted conflicting findings by other researchers regarding viral loads in younger patients, and whether that may impact infectiousness., , The team called for additional population-based studies to better establish the risk of transmission with younger COVID-19 patients. ','https://www.foxnews.com/health/younger-kids-covid-19-spread-virus-within-household-than-teens-study-finds',2,567),(449,'COVID-19 vaccine boosters: Here\'s what to know','U.S. health officials may soon recommend COVID-19 booster shots for fully vaccinated Americans. A look at what we know about boosters and how they could help fight the coronavirus:, WHY MIGHT WE NEED BOOSTERS?, It’s common for protection from vaccines to decrease over time. A tetanus booster, for example, is recommended every 10 years., Researchers and health officials have been monitoring the real-world performance of the COVID-19 vaccines to see how long protection lasts among vaccinated people. The vaccines authorized in the U.S. continue to offer very strong protection against severe disease and death., , But laboratory blood tests have suggested that antibodies — one of the immune system\'s layers of protection — can wane over time. That doesn\'t mean protection disappears, but it could mean protection is not as strong or that it could take longer for the body to fight back against an infection., The delta variant has complicated the question of when to give boosters because it is so much more contagious and much of the data gathered about vaccine performance is from before the delta variant was widely circulating. Delta is taking off at the same time that vaccine immunity might also be waning for the first people vaccinated., Israel is offering a booster to people over 50 who were vaccinated more than five months ago. France and Germany plan to offer boosters to some people in the fall. The European Medicines Agency said it too is reviewing data to see if booster shots are needed., WHEN WOULD THEY BE GIVEN?, It depends on when you got your initial shots. One possibility is that health officials will recommend people get a booster roughly eight months after getting their second shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine., , Officials are continuing to collect information about the one-shot Johnson and Johnson vaccine, which was authorized for use in the U.S. in late February, to determine when to recommend boosters., WHO WOULD GET THEM?, The first people vaccinated in the United States would likely be first in line for boosters too. That means health care workers, nursing home residents and other older Americans, who were the first to be vaccinated once the shots were authorized last December., BOOSTER? THIRD SHOT? WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE?, Transplant recipients and other people with weakened immune systems may not have gotten enough protection from vaccines to begin with. They can now receive a third dose at least 28 days after their second shot as part of their initial series of shots needed for them to be fully vaccinated. For those with normal immune systems, boosters are given much later after full vaccination — not to establish protection, but to rev it up again., WHAT QUESTIONS REMAIN?, Still unknown is whether people should get the same type of shot they got when first vaccinated. And the nation’s top health advisers will be looking for evidence about the safety of boosters and how well they protect against infection and severe disease., Global access to vaccines is also important to stem the pandemic and prevent the emergence of new variants. Booster shots could crimp already tight global vaccine supplies., WHAT ABOUT THE UNVACCINATED?, Dr. Melanie Swift, who has been leading the vaccination program at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, says getting more shots into people who haven\'t yet been vaccinated at all is \"our best tool, not only to prevent hospitalization and mortality from the delta variant, but to stop transmission.\" Every infection, she says, \"gives the virus more chances to mutate into who knows what the next variant could be.\", , \"People who took the vaccine the first time are likely to line up and get their booster,\" Swift says. \"But it’s not going to achieve our goals overall if all their unvaccinated neighbors are not vaccinated.\"','https://www.foxnews.com/health/covid-19-vaccine-boosters-what-to-know',2,568),(450,'Mississippi gets 2nd field hospital in days','On normal days, the garage is where people park while visiting Mississippi\'s only children\'s hospital, a building next door decorated with a logo of a rainbow and sun.

At least 7,880 have died since., Dobbs likens the newest Mississippi surge to a \"tsunami\" and it has overwhelmed the state\'s hospital system. On July 27, some 726 people were hospitalized with the coronavirus. By Aug. 16 that figure stood at 1,623., Patients were waiting in hallways and emergency rooms, with no beds and no staff to immediately tend to them., (), Dobbs said the virus situation in Mississippi is the worst its ever been, but even the latest field hospital will have a big impact, saying it would bring care for those \"who might not get care of otherwise.\", State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers said Tuesday that about 20,000 Mississippi students are currently quarantined for COVID-19 exposure — 4.5% of the public school population, according to the latest enrollment figures., The state called on the federal government for help, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services deployed a team of three dozen physicians, nurses and respiratory therapists last week to set up the first emergency field hospital. That site, in another parking lot at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, is serving 20 patients., Samaritan\'s Purse is known for its medical missions across the world, including in Liberia, West Africa, where it was on the frontlines of the Ebola outbreak. It is currently also in Haiti helping out after a deadly 7.2 magnitude earthquake there., Since the pandemic\'s start, the charity has set up five other emergency hospitals in areas of the world hardest hit by the virus, including in Italy, New York City and Los Angeles County., Edward Graham, assistant to the vice president of programs and government relations at Samaritan\'s Purse, said his physicians are using their training fighting Ebola and other emergencies to tackle the virus in Mississippi., \"These hospitals were designed for overseas use; we never thought we’ll be doing this,\" he said. \"But our neighbors here in Mississippi have called and asked for, and we’ve responded.\", The inflatable tents — negative pressure, to keep the virus inside — are anchored by cinderblock in case of storms or high winds., Five beds thus far have been set up to treat intensive care patients with ventilators., Outside the tents, orange fencing marks the entrance to the \"hot zone,\" where only staff clothed in full PPE — two pairs of gloves, protective gowns, goggles, hair nets, rubber boots, face coverings — can go.

The doctor spoke to the congregation at a recent Sunday service, trying to dispel myths and describing how he\'s seen families devastated by infection and deaths that vaccines could have prevented., \"I got about 10 texts later that day from people who went out to Publix that same day and got the shot,\" he said. \"A large majority of the membership now is vaccinated.\", Across town at Impact Church, Pastor George Davis buried six church members under the age of 35 in just 10 days. All had been healthy, all unvaccinated. Friends he\'s lost include a 24-year-old man Davis had known since he was a toddler, a young woman on the worship team who celebrated her first wedding anniversary just weeks before her death, and another man in his early 30s that Davis had mentored for years., The predominantly young, Black megachurch of 6,000 has a hipster vibe, with contemporary music, and jeans and sneakers welcome. Davis has partnered with community health officials to work through misconceptions about the delta variant\'s impact after officials said for months that the disease couldn\'t hurt them much., , Now, his church members can simply walk across the hall each Sunday and talk with a medical expert about their vaccine concerns. Davis also hosted two vaccination drives, where more than 1,000 got shots., \"As a pastor, honestly we really don’t have much time to lick our wounds,\" he said. \"Like a police officer, if somebody they know has been shot, they still have to reach for their weapon to protect those that are left.\"','https://www.foxnews.com/health/floridas-covid-19-hot-zone-bracing-worst',2,579),(461,'Record delta COVID-19 wave hits kids, raises fear as US schools open','The day before he was supposed to start fourth grade, Francisco Rosales was admitted to a Dallas hospital with COVID-19, struggling to breathe, with dangerously low oxygen levels and an uncertain outcome., , It wasn’t supposed to be like this, thought his frightened mother, Yessica Gonzalez. Francisco was normally healthy and rambunctious. At 9, he was too young to get vaccinated, but most of the family had their shots. She had heard kids rarely got sick from the coronavirus., But with the highly contagious delta variant spreading across the U.S., children are filling hospital intensive care beds instead of classrooms in record numbers, more even than at the height of the pandemic. Many are too young to get the vaccine, which is available only to those 12 and over., , The surging virus is spreading anxiety and causing turmoil and infighting among parents, administrators and politicians around the U.S., especially in states like Florida and Texas, where Republican governors have barred schools from making youngsters wear masks., With millions of children returning to classrooms this month, experts say the stakes are unquestionably high., Very high infection rates in the community \"are really causing our children’s hospitals to feel the squeeze,’’ said Dr. Buddy Creech, a Vanderbilt University infectious disease specialist who is a helping lead research on Moderna’s vaccine for children under 12. Creech said those shots probably won’t be available for several months., \"I’m really worried,’’ said Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, a pediatrician and public health expert at the University of Florida. \"It’s just so disappointing to see those numbers back up again.\", While pediatric COVID-19 hospitalization rates are lower than those for adults, they have surged in recent weeks, reaching 0.41 per 100,000 children ages 0 to 17, compared with 0.31 per 100,000, the previous high set in mid-January, according to an Aug. 13 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., Dr. Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health, calls the spike in cases among children \"very worrisome.\", He noted that over 400 U.S. children have died of COVID-19 since the pandemic began. \"And right now we have almost 2,000 kids in the hospital, many of them in ICU, some of them under the age of 4,’’ Collins told Fox News on Sunday., Health experts believe adults who have not gotten their shots are contributing to the surge among grownups and children alike. It has been especially bad in places with lower vaccination rates, such as parts of the South., , While it is clear the delta variant is much more contagious than the original version, scientists are not yet able to say with any certainty whether it makes people more severely ill or whether youngsters are especially vulnerable to it., As experts work to answer those questions, many hospitals are reeling. Those in Texas are among the hardest hit. On Tuesday, they reported 196 children being treated with confirmed COVID-19. That compares with 163 during the previous peak, in December., At Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, the nation’s largest pediatric hospital, the number of youngsters treated for COVID-19 is at an all-time high, said Dr. Jim Versalovic, interim pediatrician-in-chief. In recent weeks, the vast majority have had delta infections, and most patients 12 and up have not had shots, he said., \"It is spreading like wildfire across our communities,’’ he said., At times this month, his hospital system has diagnosed 200 children with COVID-19 a day, with about 6% of them needing hospital care. On some days, the number of children in the hospital with COVID-19 has exceeded 45., Versalovic said he suspects hospitalizations of children are up simply because so many are getting infected, not because the delta variant makes people more seriously ill., At Children’s Medical Center in Dallas, where Francisco is being treated, the number of patients with COVID-19 climbed from 10 during the week of July 4 to 29 during the week of Aug. 8., Francisco is improving and expected to recover, but his mother is worried and is considering home-schooling him. The virus \"is really dangerous,\'\' she said., The delta surge is yet another test for the nation\'s schools, which are dealing with students who fell behind academically as a result of remote learning or developed mental health problems from the upheaval., Outbreaks have already occurred at reopened schools in the South that are facing resistance to mask-wearing., In Texas, some school administrators are mandating masks in defiance of the governor and state Supreme Court. Among them is Michael Hinojosa of the Dallas school system, one of the state’s largest districts., \"This delta variant is different, and the numbers are really significant in the county,’’ he said. \"We’re going to continue our mask mandate to keep students safe, to keep parents safe, to keep families safe and most importantly our teachers, who are on those front lines.’’, Although dozens of students and staff have already been sickened by the virus since the Dallas district’s 180 schools began reopening on Aug. 5, the numbers are far lower than when in-person learning resumed in the spring, Hinojosa said., Knowing the toll the pandemic has taken on children, Hinojosa is determined to keep his schools open., \"We know they’ve been scarred by it,\" he said. \"That’s why they need to be back with their friends and teachers.’’, In DeSoto, a Dallas suburb, schools are also requiring masks, and Superintendent D’Andre Weaver said there has been no pushback from parents, perhaps, he added, because many are Black and know their community was hit hard earlier in the pandemic. Some considered keeping their children home because of the governor’s opposition to school mask requirements, Weaver said., , As a parent and an administrator, Weaver said the delta surge \"is a major concern, it’s a major frustration. It’s a big fear.’’, His own two girls started first and second grade this week, and the first thing he has been asking when he picks them up after school is \"How do you feel?

During a White House briefing, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky cited several studies indicating waning protection against infection over time. One study out of New York from May to July saw vaccine efficacy against new COVID-19 diagnoses slide from 92% to 80%, and a preprint from the Mayo Clinic saw Pfizer’s vaccine efficacy against infection plummet from 76% to 42% in the face of the delta variant, with Moderna’s efficacy decreasing from 86% to 76%., However, the vaccines remained effective against hospitalization., \"[I] need more data to convince me to do this as a wholesale public health policy,\" Dr. Gregory Poland, professor of medicine, infectious diseases and molecular pharmacology at the Mayo Clinic, told Fox News., , Several experts told Fox News that federal health officials’ proposed plan to rollout booster shots to most Americans come September is premature, whereas clear evidence supports a third dose among vulnerable patients with weakened immune systems (i.e. immunocompromised individuals). , \"In my opinion, a recommendation for all individuals to have a booster dose starting 8 months after an individual’s 2nd mRNA dose is too soon,\" Dr. Ravina Kullar, infectious diseases specialist, epidemiologist and adjunct faculty at David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, told Fox News., Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News medical contributor, agreed, adding that booster shots should go to immunocompromised populations and those at highest risk of exposure who were first to receive the vaccines. The move to quickly recommend booster doses across the larger population risks undermining confidence in the vaccine, he said., Several experts pointed to evidence out of Israel, which is weeks into its COVID-19 booster rollout, and just extended third shots to people aged 40 and up. Siegel, and Dr. Aaron Glatt, chairman of the department of medicine and chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau, said the U.S. can look to Israel to gain insight in navigating the issue of booster doses., \"I think there will most certainly be patients that absolutely will benefit from getting a third dose, besides the immunocompromised that definitely should get a third dose,\" Glatt said. \"I think there will be some patients that probably have robust immunity and really don’t need a third dose at this point in time, maybe they’ll never need it, that we don’t really know.\", \"At this point in time, we just don’t have enough information to know who would best benefit from it,\" he continued. , \"I think that there is some evidence, we need more evidence and I think that we’re gathering more evidence,\" he said., The debate over extending booster shots to the larger U.S. population despite the World Health Organization’s call for wealthier countries to halt booster shots as the developing world grapples under vaccine scarcity also stirred conflicting responses from experts. , , This is a global problem, providing an additional dose of the vaccine to most American people also depletes the limited global supply of vaccines with most developing countries still facing the reality of having no vaccines available,\" Kullar told Fox News., However, others disagree, including Siegel who suggested the global effort requires bolstered manufacturing capabilities, instead of the U.S. donating extra doses., \"It’s like a drop in the ocean,\" he said. , President Biden on Thursday shared a similar statement, telling ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos in part: \"We\'re providing more to the rest of the world than all the rest of the world combined,\" a transcript reads in part.','https://www.foxnews.com/health/us-covid-19-booster-plan-some-experts-divided',2,581),(463,'Over 121,000 new pediatric COVID-19 cases reported over week span','Over 121,000 children tested positive for COVID-19 last week, data revealed, marking a 5% increase in cases since the beginning of the month.

However, despite the increasing cases, the AAP notes that severe illness due to COVID-19 remains uncommon in children. , \"However, there is an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children, as well as its emotional and mental health effects,\" the AAP said in a statement. , , The increase, which follows an early summer decline, comes amid rapid spread of the delta variant, which across the south has seen hospitals once again overrun with COVID-19 patients. In the most recent AAP update, which included data from 23 states and New York City, children accounted for about 1.6% to 3.5% of COVID-19 hospitalizations, with about 0.2% to 1.9% of cases resulting in admission. The overall death rate among children due to COVID-19 remains low. The data from 43 states found 0.0% to 0.03% of all pediatric COVID-19 cases resulted in death. , Pediatricians and health experts are urging caution such as vaccinating eligible teachers and students and universal masking as a number of states have begun reopening schools to in-person learning over the last several weeks. Washington state is requiring all teachers and school personnel to be fully vaccinated by an October deadline or face possible firing. Elsewhere, the topic of how to safely return to school remains a hot topic of debate. , In New York for instance, the state has left it up to individual school districts to create their own plans. Several schools have decided to mandate masks, while others have chosen to \"recommend but not require\" them. In Florida, the state’s board of education voted to sanction two districts who defied Gov. Ron DeSantis’ order banning mask mandates in schools. , In Arkansas, where schools reopened last week and there is a law banning masks, over 800 students and staff had to enter quarantine because of COVID-19 exposure.  , , \"There are many children and others who cannot be vaccinated,\" said Sara Bode, MD, FAAP, chair-person elect of the AAP Council on School Health Executive Committee. \"This is why it’s important to use every tool in our toolkit to safeguard children from COVID-19.

Likewise, Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel previously noted the company was in the process of submitting additional late-stage trial data for FDA review., Emergency approval, issued to all three companies, comes when there are serious, threatening diseases that have no other alternative, and the vaccines must first meet the FDA’s safety and efficacy standards before they receive an EUA., , Officials are hoping that the full approval of a vaccine will ease hesitancy, and as more people roll their sleeves to receive shots, it lessens the opportunity for the virus to further mutate., Clinical trials are underway for children under 12, who cannot yet receive any COVID-19 vaccines because regulators are awaiting data regarding safety, efficacy and dosing., ','https://www.foxnews.com/health/moderna-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccines-fda-approval',2,592),(472,'Diabetes has surged among US youth, decades-long study finds','Diabetes surged among American children, teens and adolescents to 2017, according to new federally-funded research spanning nearly 20 years finding a 45% increase in type 1 diagnoses, and a 95% growth in type 2 diagnoses., \"Increases in diabetes are always troubling – especially in youth. Rising rates of diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, which is preventable, has the potential to create a cascade of poor health outcomes,\" Dr. Giuseppina Imperatore, chief of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, Economics, and Statistics Branch in CDC’s Division of Diabetes Translation, said in a statement issued Tuesday. \"Compared to people who develop diabetes in adulthood, youth are more likely to develop diabetes complications at an earlier age and are at higher risk of premature death.\", , Findings published in JAMA on Tuesday indicated that Type 1 diabetes persists as the most common type of diabetes among U.S. youth. Results stemmed from an average of 3.5 million Americans under age 20 studied on a yearly basis from 2001 to 2017 across areas of California, Colorado, Ohio, South Carolina, Washington State, Arizona and Mexico. Results indicated significant increases in type 1 diabetes among Americans 19 years or younger, from 1.48 per 1,000 young people to 2.15 per 1,000 by 2017, or a 45% increase over 16 years, whereas the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among kids aged 10-19 increased from 0.34 per 1,000 youths to 0.67 per 1,000 youths, or a 95.3% increase over 16 years., , Study authors noted no significant differences in the increases in diabetes prevalence across sexes., The study found the largest increases in type 2 diabetes were among Black and Hispanic youth, with increases in the estimated prevalence of type 1 diabetes greatest among Black and White youths. Kids under age 9 with type 2 diabetes were excluded from the study due to small sample sizes., Diabetes is a chronic health condition impacting how the body converts food into energy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \"If you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use the insulin it makes as well as it should. When there isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.\", , While there is no cure, diabetes patients can manage the disease through medication, insulin therapy, weight loss, a healthy diet and exercise. Most people who have diabetes have type 2 diabetes, which develops over many years and is typically diagnosed in adulthood, though increasing diagnoses are occurring earlier in life. Type 1 diabetes is believed to involve an autoimmune reaction that prevents the body from making insulin; type 1 patients comprise some 5%-10% of diabetes patients, and is usually diagnosed in childhood, requiring daily insulin., The CDC notes diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., and in the last 20 years, the share of U.S. adults with diabetes diagnoses more than doubled., , \"More research is needed to better understand the underlying causes of the increases we’re seeing in type 1 and type 2 diabetes in U.S. youth,\" Jean Lawrence, lead author on the paper and director of the Diabetes Epidemiology Program, Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolic Diseases in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases at the NIH, said in a statement. \"Increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes could be caused by rising rates of childhood obesity, in utero exposure to maternal obesity and diabetes, or increased diabetes screenings.

Wednesday’s findings are expected to inform the U.S. booster strategy set to begin in September, when the U.S. plans to begin offering boosters to people who received messenger-RNA vaccines. Later it is likely to expand the program to include JandJ’s viral-vector vaccine., , JandJ said researchers found antibody levels increased ninefold among people who received a second dose of its vaccine, compared with one month after they received a first dose. The company didn’t specify exactly when or how many subjects received the second dose, though information posted about the clinical trial in an online government database indicates it was administered six months after the first shot., JandJ said that it will submit data from two studies to a preprint server, meaning that the data haven’t been peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal., JandJ also said a booster is needed after eight months based on interim data it reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in July, which showed strong antibody responses through eight months after immunization with the JandJ one-dose shot., ?, \"We look forward to discussing with public health officials a potential strategy for our Johnson and Johnson Covid-19 vaccine, boosting eight months or longer after the primary single-dose vaccination,\" Dr. Mathai Mammen, global head of RandD at Janssen Pharmaceutical Cos. of Johnson and Johnson, said Wednesday., The Biden administration said last week that people ages 18 and older who got the Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer Inc. or Moderna Inc. should get an extra dose eight months later, reflecting heightened concern over the highly contagious Delta variant and data showing initial immunity to Covid-19 diminishes over time. JandJ\'s suggested timeline would be in sync with that broader strategy., (), Currently boosters are only authorized for immunocompromised people who received two-dose messenger-RNA vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration must authorize extra doses before they can be offered more broadly as recommended by the Biden administration to those 18 and older who received two-dose messenger-RNA vaccines, and it is expected to do so before Sept. 20, when health authorities said messenger-RNA boosters would become available, The CDC\'s expert advisory panel on vaccines will meet next week to discuss the Biden administration\'s plans for booster shots., The JandJ vaccine is authorized for emergency use in people 18 and older. Only Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE\'s vaccine is fully approved by the FDA for those 16 and older. Moderna\'s two-shot messenger-RNA vaccine has emergency authorization for people 18 and over. , Nearly 14 million people in the U.S. have received a single-dose JandJ vaccine, according to CDC data., \"The single-dose vaccine is still highly protective, and we know that -- that is not diminished, but now we also know that a second dose given at six months boosts immune responses substantially,\" said Dr. Dan Barouch, who contributed to the development of the JandJ vaccine but wasn\'t directly involved in the booster information shared Wednesday. He was part of the New England Journal of Medicine study showing the vaccine\'s protections held for eight months., ?, Use of the JandJ shot dropped after U.S. health authorities in April temporarily paused rollout of the shots to investigate reports of a rare blood-clotting condition., The company added a warning to its label in July saying its vaccine is linked to a very small incidence of cases of a rare neurological disorder seen with other vaccines or viral infections, called Guillain-Barré syndrome., Early studies have mostly shown that JandJ\'s vaccine holds up well against the Delta variant. A recent study from South Africa including nearly 480,000 healthcare workers found that the JandJ vaccine has an efficacy of up to 71% against hospitalization resulting from the Delta variant, 67% against hospitalization from the Beta strain and up to 96% against death overall, though another study suggested a single dose elicited a relatively weak antibody response against Delta., JandJ is also studying the efficacy of two doses of its vaccine, in an effort separate from the results released Wednesday.

From October to mid-February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recorded 165-laboratory confirmed flu-related hospitalizations in the U.S., the lowest rate of flu-related hospitalizations since data collection began in 2005., However doctors\' warnings have resurfaced, with experts citing social mixing and relaxed mitigation measures as the country approaches the colder seasons., , \"This year, however, we are heading into the flu season with more relaxed restrictions and the situation will allow for increased chance of respiratory illness transmissions,\" Dr. TingTing Wong, internist and infectious disease specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian Medical Group Brooklyn, told Fox News. \"We saw a similar uptick of \'summer colds\' caused by other viruses (for example RSV, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhino viruses, etc.) this summer as restrictions relaxed and the fear is a similar uptick of flu cases this fall/winter season.\", \"Bottom line, please get the flu vaccine early!\" Wong added., National reports of RSV, a common respiratory virus, increased into July, nearly hitting highs not seen since late fall to winter of 2019, according to laboratory data submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

A failure could expose flaws in its health system, including a shortage of hospital beds and a slow vaccine rollout., The high-stakes campaign hinges on whether new infections, which have risen for the past 10 days, begin to drop., Last week, the government put the nation into the full lockdown after only a single community case was detected in the city of Auckland., , \"It’s counterintuitive,\" said epidemiologist Michael Baker. \"When there’s a threat, you usually increase the response as it gets more dangerous. Here, we’re doing the opposite, with the maximum response when the threat is tiny.\", It\'s a strategy that has worked incredibly well for New Zealand but faces its biggest test against a tougher enemy: the highly contagious delta variant of the virus. Baker, a professor at the University of Otago, said the strategy was the best approach and he was optimistic it would succeed again., Since the pandemic began, New Zealand has reported only 26 deaths from the virus in a population of 5 million. The death rate per capita in Britain and the U.S. is about 400 times higher. Remarkably, life expectancy for New Zealanders actually rose in 2020 as virus measures helped reduce other seasonal ailments like the flu., The U.S. is in the grip of a wave of infection powered by the delta variant, which has sent cases, deaths and hospitalizations soaring again, wiping out months of progress., New Zealanders lived virus-free in the six months leading up to the latest outbreak, going to workplaces, stores and sports stadiums without needing to wear masks, while children attended school., , Then a traveler returning from Sydney brought the delta variant and it somehow escaped from a quarantine hotel. The outbreak has grown to about 350 known cases and is straining New Zealand\'s contact-tracing system as workers try to track down 30,000 other people who might have been exposed., New Zealand has a large diaspora of Pacific Island people. The outbreak has hit this community particularly hard after spreading at a Samoan church event that drew hundreds. That led to some racist attacks on social media., \"This is disappointing and, frankly, gutless,\" said Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of public health. \"I’m asking everyone in the country to be kind.\", The lockdown prevents most people from leaving home other than to exercise, or to buy groceries or medicine. Retail stores are closed, as are restaurants — including takeout — schools and most businesses., While much of the world is learning to live with the virus and has moved away from hard lockdowns, most New Zealanders still embrace them., \"Fortunately, there\'s a great team spirit,\" said Lesley Gray, a public health specialist at the University of Otago. \"It\'s quite obvious to me that the country would rather keep this out. We want to stamp it out, keep it out.\", Among the handful of other places that have successfully pursued virus elimination strategies are China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore., Nearby Australia stamped out previous outbreaks but leaders say they can\'t get rid of the delta variant, which has continued to spread in Sydney despite a two-month lockdown. New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian says she\'ll ease restrictions for vaccinated adults next month, despite record infection numbers reaching more than 1,000 a day., George Williams, a constitutional law expert at the University of New South Wales, said that while he supports the Sydney lockdown, he also sees risks in the government getting too comfortable in using its extraordinary powers., \"They\'re pretty draconian, quite authoritarian measures, which would be unthinkable outside a pandemic,\" he said, noting that unlike in many democracies, Australians aren\'t protected by a Bill of Rights., Some Australians also are tiring of lockdowns. Hundreds have been arrested and given heavy fines this month for defying health orders at protests., In New Zealand, where the lockdown is even stricter, Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said about 70 protesters and other rule-breakers have been arrested since it began, but he\'s happy with the overall level of compliance., With little else to do, many New Zealanders watch daily news conferences held by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and others. Like a slow-moving forensic drama, the briefings outline the latest infections, places those people visited and genome-sequencing results., There have been moments of levity, such as when COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins misspoke about exercising outdoors, saying people could go \"spread their legs\" — a comment quickly mocked on social media., But there will be serious consequences if the lockdown fails., New Zealand\'s vaccine rollout has been the slowest of any developed nation, with only 39% of people having gotten at least one shot and 22% fully vaccinated. The country chose to use only the Pfizer vaccine and didn\'t approve its use until two months after U.S. regulators first approved it for emergency use., The government blames the initial slowness of the rollout on Pfizer\'s delivery schedule., But opposition lawmaker Chris Bishop said the government’s \"negligent execution of the rollout has left New Zealand a sitting duck for the delta variant.\", Vaccinations have sped up rapidly since the outbreak began, with health workers now giving doses to nearly 2% of the population every day., Another challenge is a lack of intensive-care hospital beds. A recent report by a group of experts noted that at the pandemic\'s start, New Zealand had fewer than one-third the number than the average in developed nations, and little had changed since then., \"The New Zealand health system is still poorly resourced to deal with any large outbreak of a disease such as COVID-19,\" the report found., , Many New Zealanders are desperate to visit relatives abroad and want to know when the lockdowns will end and the borders will reopen.

The hospital\'s phone system was down., \"Once it is safe to do so they will evacuate their small number of patients,\" state health department spokeswoman Aly Neel said in an email. Details on the number of patients involved were not immediately available., , Another Lafourche Parish hospital, Thibodaux Regional Medical Center, reported a partial generator failure to the state. Christina Stephens, a spokesperson for Gov. John Bel Edwards, said the facility \"had not lost all critical power.\" She said some patients were moved to another part of the facility and the state health department was working with the hospital., Ida struck as hospitals and their intensive care units were filled with patients from the fourth surge of the COVID-19 pandemic, sparked by the highly contagious delta variant and low vaccination rates across Louisiana., Daily tallies of new cases in Louisiana went from a few hundred a day through much of the spring and early summer to thousands a day by late July. Gov. John Bel Edwards told The Associated Press on Sunday that more than 2,400 COVID-19 patients are in Louisiana hospitals, saying the state was in a \"very dangerous place with our hospitals.\", The governor also said 22 nursing homes and 18 assisted living facilities have been evacuated, though evacuating the largest hospitals was not an option because there simply aren\'t other places to send them. Anticipating that power could be out for weeks in places, Edwards said a big focus will be on making sure there is enough generator power and water at hospitals so they can keep up with vital patient needs such as providing oxygen or powering ventilators., , \"I hate to say it this way, but we have a lot of people on ventilators today and they don’t work without electricity,\" he said., Officials at Ochsner Health, which runs the largest hospital network in Louisiana, said roughly 15 of the network\'s hospitals are in areas potentially affected by Ida. The network evacuated some patients with particular medical needs from small, rural hospitals to larger facilities., Warner Thomas, president and CEO of Ochsner Health, said Sunday that the system decided preemptively to evacuate a smaller hospital in St. Charles Parish when the storm’s track shifted a bit east., He said 35 patients were moved to other hospitals in the region over a little less than three hours. When it comes to power at their facilities, Mike Hulefeld said, they are in pretty good shape. Three of their facilities in areas affected by Ida were moved to generator power in anticipation of losing city power., Later Sunday the hospital system said they planned to evacuate all patients at two other hospitals in the system on Monday as soon as conditions allowed. One hospital, with 21 patients in Raceland, suffered roof damage while the other facility with 45 patients in Houma had roof damage and power issues. Other facilities have suffered roof damage, water leaks and some damage to windows that required moving patients. At the hospital\'s main campus just outside of New Orleans, Thomas said they\'d had problems with water leaks but no structural issues and had performed some surgeries Sunday. They\'ve had no injuries reported., , \"We\'ll know a lot more tomorrow morning when we have daylight,\" he said., Hulefeld said the hospital network ordered 10 days of supplies for facilities in areas that might be affected by Ida, and everything arrived Saturday. Each facility has backup power that was tested and a backup fuel truck on-site. Many of the chain’s hospitals also have water wells in case city water goes out., With people evacuating and potentially going to stay with relatives or in shelters, medical officials said they are concerned the hurricane could translate into more coronavirus infections in coming days just as hospitalization numbers are going down.

Its use, they said, would be needed in one of two scenarios: when the initial immune response from the first of two vaccine doses is insufficient or when the initial immune response wanes over time. , , The panel noted that it is not uncommon for some diseases to require more than two vaccine doses – as has been the case with COVID. Hepatitis B and HPV, for instance, require a third jab at least six months after the second dose. , Still, the ACIP reached no definitive conclusion and will meet again in mid-September. , The debate among health officials over a third vaccine dose continues. U.S. health officials announced earlier this month plans to dispense COVID-19 booster shots to all Americans to shore up their protection amid the surging delta variant and signs that the vaccines’ effectiveness is slipping. , , Laboratory blood tests have suggested that antibodies – one of the immune system’s layers of protection can wane over time.

Researchers looked at antibody levels in blood tests before vaccination, and up to 10 weeks following participants\' second dose., , Overall, the Moderna vaccine elicited an antibody level of 3,836 U/mL, compared to 1,444 U/mL following the Pfizer vaccine, and among participants previously uninfected, researchers reported 2,881 U/mL for Moderna versus 1,108 U/mL for Pfizer. Study authors suggested the difference could be explained by the higher mRNA content in the Moderna vaccine, and the longer gap between the first and second dose (4 weeks vs 3 weeks for Pfizer)., \"A relationship between neutralization level after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and protection against COVID-19 has been demonstrated by several studies,\" the letter reads. \"As such, the height of the humoral response after vaccination, which correlates with neutralizing antibody titers, might be clinically relevant.\", , The study had its limitations, like lacking data on cellular immunity, and the focus on healthcare workers. Researchers said further research is needed to determine whether the differences in antibody level conveys a difference in lasting protection. , Separate findings from the Mayo Clinic recently indicated the Moderna vaccine cut COVID-related hospitalizations by about half the rate compared to the Pfizer vaccine. Study authors suggested several factors behind the differences observed among the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, including the dosing, meaning \"each mRNA-1273 [Moderna] dose provides three times more mRNA copies of the Spike protein than BNT162b2 [Pfizer], which could result in more effective priming of the immune response.\"','https://www.foxnews.com/health/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-antibodies-pfizer-shot-study',2,624),(504,'Organ transplants saw marked decline worldwide amid pandemic: study','An observational study spanning four continents indicated a marked decline in the number of solid organ transplants amid the COVID-19 pandemic, likely due to risk of infection and limited resources., The France-backed study published in The Lancet Public Health journal on Monday stemmed from 22 countries, including the U.S., Canada, 16 countries across Europe and three in South America.

In June, however, NeNe confirmed that his cancer had returned., , (), Nearly all colorectal cancers start as abnormal growths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which notes the growths, or \"precancerous polyps\" may not result in symptoms for years. However, colorectal cancer screenings can help find the growths so they can be removed before progressing to cancer., \"The most effective way to reduce your risk of colorectal cancer is to get screened for colorectal cancer routinely, beginning at age 45,\" per the health agency’s webpage, which notes millions of Americans are missing recommended screenings and the chance to find and treat the cancer early. By 2018, 68.8% of U.S. adults aged 50-75 were up-to-date on colorectal cancer screening, up from 67.4% in 2016., , Colon and rectum cancers occurred at a rate of 36.5 per 100,000 in 2018, with over 140,000 new reported cancer cases and 52,163 related deaths that year, per the latest available figures. Annual rates of new colorectal cancers and cancer-related deaths in the U.S. have been gradually declining since 1999, though the number of new annual cases has increased on several occasions., (), Aside from screenings, lifestyle changes may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, like boosting exercise, limiting alcohol intake and avoiding tobacco. Researchers are working to determine whether aspirin use and diet changes can lower the risk of colorectal cancer too, according to the CDC., Colon cancer risk increases with age, but other risk factors include inflammatory bowel disease, personal or family history of colorectal cancer or colorectal polyps and a genetic syndrome (familial adenomatous polyposis or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome), the agency adds., Symptoms may include change in bowel habits, bloody stool, diarrhea, abdominal pain, cramps and inexplicable weight loss, among others.

Those living in villages were randomly assigned a number of interventions to promote the use of masks. , Researchers found that those living in the villages with such interventions were around 11% less likely to develop COVID-19 than those who did not.

Additionally, individuals not wearing masks nor social distancing were regularly reminded to do so. , In villages without these interventions, around 13% of people wore masks properly compared to 42% in villages with the guidance.

RENOIR is expected to test around 30,000 participants over the age of 60 globally, says Pfizer., RSV, commonly mistaken for COVID-19 due to similarities in symptoms, is a common respiratory virus. According to the CDC, most children likely had an RSV infection by the age of 2. While most adults recover within one to two weeks, RSV can be dangerous for infants and the elderly., For children younger than 1 year, RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Symptoms of RSV usually come in stages and can include, but are not limited to: runny nose, decrease in appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing., This summer, there has been an unusual uptick in RSV cases. RSV and other respiratory viruses cases usually start to increase in the fall and peak in the winter. According to Pfizer, about 177,000 older adults over the age of 65 contract RSV, and about 14,000 of those cases are fatal, making the vaccine even more crucial given how dangerous it can be for infants and the elderly., , \"RSV is a significant cause of severe respiratory disease in older adults, and it can cause disability and death.
